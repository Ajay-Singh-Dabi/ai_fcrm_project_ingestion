Federal bank regulatory agencies will hold a hybrid public outreach meeting on October 30, 2025, in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of their review of regulations. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) requires the agencies, with input from the public, to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify any outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements applicable to certain supervised institutions.

The outreach meeting is an opportunity for interested stakeholders to present their views on the regulatory categories listed in any of the four Federal Register notices : Applications and Reporting; Powers and Activities; International Operations; Consumer Protection; Directors, Officers and Employees; Money Laundering; Rules of Procedure; Safety and Soundness; Securities; Banking Operations; Capital; and the Community Reinvestment Act.

Individuals interested in providing oral comments, either virtually or in person, must register by October 22, 2025, and indicate the regulatory category or categories they would like to discuss. The agencies will notify those individuals selected to provide comments.

Advance registration is also required to attend this public meeting as an in-person observer. Additional details, including a link to attend the meeting virtually, will be available on the EGRPRA website under the outreach page .

The agencies will announce additional public meetings in the coming months.

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday modified Morgan Stanley's stress capital buffer requirement, after the firm requested reconsideration. As a result, the bank's requirement for this year is 4.3 percent, down from a preliminary 5.1 percent.

The Board's stress test process allows banks to request reconsideration of their stress capital buffer requirement, which is the capital requirement stemming from the stress test. A bank is required to submit a detailed explanation of why reconsideration should be granted, and the Board then conducts an independent assessment of the request.

Based on an analysis of information presented by Morgan Stanley, the Board determined that estimated losses in the bank's fair value option loan portfolio were too conservative. This was due, in part, to the unique composition of the bank's loan portfolio. In addition, the Board determined to use the bank's second largest counterparty when measuring counterparty losses associated with default of the largest counterparty, as doing so would be more consistent with the Board's treatment of similar counterparties.

The Board will also consider any potential stress test model refinements related to this request in its upcoming proposal to improve the transparency of the stress test.

Preface

The Federal Reserve promotes a safe, sound, and efficient banking system that supports the U.S.

economy through its supervision and regulation of domestic and foreign banks.

As part of its supervision efforts, the Federal Reserve annually conducts a supervisory stress

test. The stress test assesses how large banks are likely to perform under hypothetical economic
conditions.1 Figure 1 summarizes the stress test cycle.

Figure 1. How stress testing works for large banks

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to ensure that large banks are sufficiently capitalized and able to lend to
households and businesses even in a severe recession. The stress tests evaluate the financial resilience of banks by
estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital levels under hypothetical economic conditions.

1 At times, Federal Reserve staff engage staff from banks subject to the stress test to better understand the submitted
bank data and make adjustments, if needed.

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to help ensure that large banks are sufficiently capital-

ized and able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. They evaluate the

financial resilience of banks by estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital levels

under hypothetical economic conditions.

1 U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), covered savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs), and intermediate holding

companies of foreign banking organizations (IHCs) with $100 billion or more in assets are subject to the Federal
Reserve Board’s supervisory stress test rules (12 C.F.R. pt. 238, subpt. O; pt. 252, subpt. E) and capital planning
requirements (12 C.F.R. §§ 225.8; 238.170).

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

As part of the annual supervisory stress test cycle, the Federal Reserve publishes four

documents:

• Stress Test Scenarios describes the hypothetical economic conditions used in the supervisory

stress test. The Stress Test Scenarios document is typically published by mid-February.

• Supervisory Stress Test Methodology provides details about the models and methodologies used

in the supervisory stress test.

• Federal Reserve Stress Test Results reports the aggregate and individual bank results of the

supervisory stress test, which assesses whether banks are sufficiently capitalized to absorb

losses during a hypothetical severe recession. The Federal Reserve Stress Test Results docu-

ment is typically published at the end of the second quarter.

• Large Bank Capital Requirements announces the individual capital requirements for all large

banks, which are partially informed by the results of the supervisory stress test. The Large

Bank Capital Requirements document is typically published during the third quarter.

These publications can be found on the Stress Test Publications page (https://

www.federalreserve.gov/publications/dodd-frank-act-stress-test-publications.htm).

Introduction

The 2025 stress test occurs in a year in which the Board has not yet completed changes to the

stress test framework. Those changes are designed to increase transparency and reduce the year-

over-year volatility of stress test results.

Summary of Results

The 2025 stress test results show that the 22 large banks subject to the test this year have suffi-

cient capital to absorb nearly $550 billion in losses and continue lending to households and busi-

nesses under hypothetical stressful conditions.

Under the severely adverse scenario, the aggregate common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of

the 22 banks subject to the stress test this year falls from an actual 13.4 percent in the fourth

quarter of 2024 to its projected minimum of 11.6 percent, before rising to 12.8 percent at the

end of the projection horizon (see table 1). The aggregate and individual bank post-stress CET1

capital ratios remain above the required minimum regulatory levels throughout the projection

horizon.

Note: The capital ratios are calculated using the capital action assumptions provided within the supervisory stress
testing rules. See 12 C.F.R. §§ 238.132(d); 252.44(c). These projections represent hypothetical estimates that
involve an economic outcome that is more adverse than expected. The minimum capital ratios are for the period
2025:Q1 to 2027:Q1. Supplementary leverage ratio projections only include estimates for banks subject to Category I,
II, or III standards.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

Figure 2. Aggregate maximum decline in stressed common equity tier 1 capital ratio, severely adverse
scenario

Note: Each bar represents the aggregate maximum common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio decline of the banks in
each exercise.

As shown in figure 2, the 1.8 percentage point aggregate decline this year is smaller than the

aggregate decline in recent years.

As highlighted in figure 3, several factors drive the smaller aggregate decline in CET1 capital

ratios compared to the prior year:

• Lower loan losses as a result of a less severe scenario: The 2025 severely adverse scenario is

less severe than the 2024 severely adverse scenario. This is due to the mild slowing in the

U.S. economy over 2024 and the countercyclical design of the Board’s annual hypothetical sce-

nario. For example, the 2025 severely adverse scenario features a smaller increase in the

unemployment rate (+5.9 percentage points) compared with the 2024 scenario (+6.3 per-

centage points). Table 2 compares several scenario variables across the 2025 and 2024

severely adverse scenarios.

• Lower private equity losses due to change in treatment: As part of the 2025 stress test, pri-

vate equity exposures are removed from the global market shock component of the stress test.

Instead, losses on these exposures are projected under the severely adverse macroeconomic

scenario. This change better aligns with the characteristics of private equity exposures, which
are principally long-term investments that are managed as banking book positions.2

2025 Supervisory Stress Test Methodology (Washington: Board of Governors, June 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/
publications/files/2025-june-supervisory-stress-test-methodology.pdf. To improve the transparency of the stress test,
the Board intends to disclose and seek public comment on the models and scenario design framework that determine
the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress. In light of this upcoming process, for the 2025 stress test,
the Board opted to use largely identical models to those used during the 2024 stress test.

Note: The 2024 stress test bar shows the aggregate common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital decline resulting from the
2024 stress test. The scenario, private equity losses, pre-provision net revenue, and trading and counterparty losses
bars show the impact that changes in each of these elements had on the difference between 2024 and 2025 stress
test results. As a percent of starting risk-weighted assets, other changes accounting for less than 0.1 percent of the
difference between 2025 stress test and 2024 stress test CET1 capital decline are not included in this chart. The
2025 stress test bar shows the aggregate CET1 capital decline resulting from the 2025 stress test. The sample
includes the 22 banks subject to the supervisory stress test in 2025 compared with those 22 banks in the 2024
supervisory stress test. The figure is based on numbers at the minimum aggregate capital ratio quarter (fourth quarter)
of the 2025 stress test. Values may not sum precisely due to rounding.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

• Significantly higher projected pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) under stress, primarily as a

result of strong recent profitability and models that are sensitive to recent data: Over the

past year, bank profitability has improved due largely to robust capital markets activity and sus-

tained strength in net interest margins. Through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s models,

stronger recent profitability leads to higher projections of PPNR under stress relative to recent
years when bank profitability was not as strong.3

• Atypical trading positions: The stress test results also reflect trading positions driven by

atypical client behavior at certain banks in early October 2024, when positions were measured

for the 2025 stress test. These positions lead to a large improvement in trading losses for

those banks in this year’s test.

Further details on this year’s results are provided in the “Results for Banks under the Severely

Adverse Scenario” section of this report, which includes results presented both in the aggregate

and for individual banks.

Implications of Changes to the Stress Test Framework

In April of this year, the Board proposed a rule to average the stress test results over two consecu-
tive years to reduce the volatility in capital requirements.4 The Board is currently reviewing and

considering the comments received on the proposal. If the Board finalizes the rule as proposed, it

would require averaging this year’s results with those of the 2024 stress test to calculate each

bank’s stress capital buffer requirement. Figure 4 shows the implications of this hypothetical aver-

aging for the results that would inform banks’ stress capital buffer requirements. Averaging the

2024 and 2025 results would lead to an aggregate post-stress capital decline of 2.3 percentage
points.5

In addition, in the coming months, the Board intends to improve the transparency of the stress

test process by disclosing and seeking public comment on the models and scenario design frame-

work that determine banks’ hypothetical losses and revenues under stress. Through this new

approach, the Board expects to obtain valuable feedback that could improve risk capture and

model performance within the framework.

3 The Board’s stress test models are sensitive to changes in recent data and the models tend to amplify the effect of
recent changes in bank data. In particular, in the 2025 stress test, the pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) models
respond strongly to an improvement in recent performance. This sensitivity to recent data leads to additional volatility in
this year’s results.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

7

Background

The results of the 2025 stress test include information for each bank, such as capital ratios,

pre-tax net income, losses, revenues, and expenses, projected under severely adverse economic

and financial conditions.

Stress Test Process

The Federal Reserve projects these stress test results using a set of supervisory models that take

as inputs bank-provided data on their financial conditions and risk characteristics, as well as the

Federal Reserve’s scenarios. The stress test uses models developed or selected by the Federal

Reserve, which may be refined each year in advance of the stress test, and these models use
bank-provided data collected primarily through regulatory reporting.6 This year, the supervisory

severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession accompanied by a period

of heightened stress in commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate
debt markets.7

Participating Banks

A total of 22 banks are participating in this year’s stress test.8 Figure 5 shows when different

types of banks are required to participate in the supervisory stress test, and table 3 lists partici-

pating banks for this year. In 2024, 31 banks participated in the stress test because Category IV
banks are generally required to participate in the test every other year.9 Therefore, the aggregate

results reported for the 2025 stress test are not fully comparable with the 2024 stress test

results. This year, 20 banks were required to participate in the stress test, and two Category IV

banks elected to participate.

In the immediate years after the 2007–09 Global Financial Crisis, banks subject to the stress test

substantially increased their capital, which has remained level for the past few years (see figure 6).

narios (Washington: Board of Governors, February 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-
stress-test-scenarios-20250205.pdf.

8 The Federal Reserve expects banks to wait until after 4:30 p.m. EDT on July 1, 2025, to publicly disclose any informa-
tion about their planned capital actions and preliminary stress capital buffer requirements. This will give all banks suffi-
cient time to examine and understand their individual results.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

Box 1. Model Adjustments in the 2025 Stress Test

The Federal Reserve regularly monitors model performance and evaluates whether any adjustments to
models are warranted. The Board has opted to use largely identical models to those used during the
2024 stress test for the 2025 stress test. The only material changes to the models in the 2025 stress
test are those that the Board began to phase in during the 2024 cycle, and the change in the treat-
ment of private equity that was described in the December 30, 2024, Questions and Answers.1 Fol-
lowing the Federal Reserve’s policies related to model risk management, these adjustments are
reviewed by an independent validation group. Additionally, when producing stress test projections, the
Federal Reserve considers issues specific to individual banks, such as the impact of recent mergers,
acquisitions, or divestitures.

For the 2025 stress test, the Federal Reserve clarified how certain data should be reported by banks
and made several model adjustments beyond those described in the stress test methodology
document.2

• To improve the Federal Reserve’s projection of expenses, the Federal Reserve adjusted the historical

data for noninterest expense models to exclude certain “non-recurring” expenses. To make this
adjustment, the Federal Reserve excluded expenses reported by the banks that were: (1) not likely
to recur in the next two years or did not occur in the prior two years, or (2) those related to business
changes (such as mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures).3

• Portfolio layer method (PLM) hedges can offset gains or losses associated with other comprehensive
income from securities. The Federal Reserve adjusted securities models to include additional infor-
mation on PLM hedges to more accurately project securities gains and losses in the stress test.

• When a bank sells assets or businesses, it may use divestiture accounting in its financial state-

ments until the sale is consummated. Under divestiture accounting, a bank may list divested assets
as discontinued operations, classify them as held for sale or available for sale instead of held for
investment or held to maturity, and report revenues as income from discontinued operations. For the
2025 stress test, to ensure consistent treatment across assets with similar risks, the Federal
Reserve adjusted certain input data that had been reclassified due to divestiture accounting to
improve projections of loan losses and related income.

• Synthetic securitizations are a form of loss mitigation in which a bank partially transfers credit risk
on specific portfolios to outside investors through credit derivatives or guarantees. The Federal
Reserve incorporated a richer dataset and considered this type of credit protection in modeling fair-
value-option/held-for sale loan losses.

buffer requirement, as well as Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, “Response to request for reconsideration of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s preliminary stress capital buffer requirement,

Results for Banks under the Severely
Adverse Scenario

This section details the Federal Reserve’s results for the 2025 supervisory stress test under the

severely adverse scenario. The results are presented both in the aggregate and for indi-

vidual banks.

The aggregate results incorporate the combined sensitivities of capital, losses, revenues, and

expenses across all banks to the stressed economic and financial market conditions included in

the severely adverse scenario. The range of results across individual banks indicates differences

in business focus, asset composition, revenue and expense sources, and portfolio risk character-

istics. Box 2 describes the results of the 2025 exploratory analysis. The comprehensive 2025

stress test results for individual banks are in appendix A.

Capital

Under the severely adverse scenario, the aggregate CET1 capital ratio is projected to decline from

an actual 13.4 percent at the start of the projection horizon to a minimum of 11.6 percent before

rising to 12.8 percent at the end of nine quarters (see table 4). Tables 5 and 6 present post-

stress minimum capital ratios for each bank and the change from the start of the projection

horizon, which varies considerably across banks (see figure 7). This variation is due to differences

in banks’ business lines, portfolio composition, and securities and loan risk characteristics, which

drive changes in the magnitude and timing of loss, revenue, and expense projections.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

Pre-tax Net Income

Projections of pre-tax net income are the largest component of post-stress changes in capital.10

Over the nine quarters of the projection horizon, aggregate cumulative pre-tax net income is pro-

jected to be negative $80 billion, which equals negative 0.4 percent of average total assets (see

table 7). As a percent of average assets, projected cumulative pre-tax net income is negative for

16 of the 22 banks and varies considerably across banks, from negative 3.1 percent to positive

3.7 percent (see figure 8 and table 8). This range illustrates differences in the sensitivity of the

various components of pre-tax net income to the economic and financial market conditions in the

severely adverse scenario. These components include cumulative projections of losses and PPNR,

which are discussed in further detail below.

10 For risk-based capital ratios, the numerator is capital, which is primarily impacted from pre-tax net income and gains/

losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. The denominator for risk-based capital ratios is risk-weighted assets.
Risk-weighted assets change minimally throughout the projection horizon as the result of an assumption that a bank’s
assets generally remain unchanged.

Over the projection horizon, aggregate losses

on loans and other positions are projected to

be $549 billion. These losses comprise

• $472 billion in loan losses, accounting for

86 percent of total losses;

• $30 billion in additional losses from items

such as loans booked under the fair-value

option (see table 7), accounting for 6 per-

cent of total losses;

• $42 billion in trading and counterparty

losses at the 10 banks with substantial

trading, processing, or custodial opera-

tions, accounting for 8 percent of total
losses; and11

• $4 billion in securities losses, accounting

for 1 percent of total losses (see
figure 9).12

For loans measured at amortized cost, projected aggregate losses are $472 billion, with the loan
loss rate at 6.6 percent (see table 9).13 These loan losses flow into pre-tax net income through

the projection of provisions for loan and lease losses, which is $473 billion in aggregate and

takes into account banks’ established allowances for credit losses at the start of the projection
horizon.14

11 The banks subject to the global market shock component and/or the largest counterparty default component are Bank
of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation; Barclays US LLC; Citigroup, Inc.; DB USA Corpora-
tion; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; State Street Corporation; and Wells
Fargo & Company.

12 For banks that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the Federal Reserve incorporated its projection of expected credit losses on
securities in the allowance for credit losses, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), “Financial
Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326),” FASB ASU 2016-13 (Norwalk, CT: FASB, June 2016). Prior to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13, securities credit losses were realized through other-than-temporary impairment.

13 The loss rate is calculated as total projected loan losses over the nine quarters of the projection horizon divided by

average loan balances over the horizon.

14 Provisions for loan and lease losses equal projected loan losses plus the amount needed for the allowance to be at an

appropriate level at the end of each quarter.

2 HELOCs (home equity lines of credit).

3 Commercial and industrial loans include small- and medium-enterprise loans and corporate cards.

4 Other consumer loans include student loans and automobile loans.

5 Other loans include international real estate loans.

Projected consumer loan losses represent a smaller share (40 percent) of total losses than com-

mercial loan losses (46 percent). The loan portfolio that constitutes the largest amount of losses

is credit cards, representing 29 percent of total losses.

Total loan loss rates vary significantly across banks, ranging between 1.2 percent and 16.4 per-

cent (see table 10). This range results from differences in loan portfolio composition, which mate-

rially affects losses because projected loss rates vary significantly for different types of loans. For

example, aggregate loan loss rates range from 1.9 percent on domestic first-lien mortgages to

16.9 percent on credit cards because of the sensitivity and historical performance of these loans.

Some loan portfolios are sensitive to home prices or unemployment rates and may experience

high stressed loss rates due to the considerable stress on these factors in the severely adverse
scenario.15

15 In addition, losses are calculated based on the exposure at default, which includes both outstanding balances and any
additional drawdown of the credit line that occurs prior to default, while loss rates are calculated as a percentage of
average outstanding balances over the projection horizon.

Results for Banks under the Severely Adverse Scenario

Loan loss rates also reflect differences in the characteristics of loans within each portfolio. For

example, the median projected loss rate on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans across all

banks is 7.8 percent. The loss rate on C&I loans among individual banks ranges from 2.3 percent

to 17.5 percent. For credit cards, the range of projected loss rates among banks is 9.7 percent to

23.4 percent, and the median is 17.4 percent.

For loans measured at fair value, losses enter pre-tax net income through the other loans loss cat-

egory (see table 8). Loans measured at amortized cost and those measured at fair value generally

have similar risk factors, but the latter are exposed to risk from the effects of market fluctuations,

which can lead to more severe market value losses in periods of high market volatility or asset illi-

quidity.

Aggregate trading and counterparty losses, which also flow into pre-tax net income, are $42 billion

for the 10 banks subject to the global market shock component and/or the largest counterparty

default component of the severely adverse scenario. Individual bank losses range from less than

$1 billion to more than $10 billion, resulting from the specific risk characteristics of each bank’s

trading positions and counterparty exposures, inclusive of hedges (see table 8). Importantly, these

projected losses are based on the trading positions and counterparty exposures held by banks on

the same as-of date (October 11, 2024) and could have varied if they had been based on a dif-

ferent date.

Aggregate credit losses on investment securities are $4 billion (see table 7). In addition, unreal-

ized gains and losses on AFS debt securities are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI).16 Other comprehensive income (OCI) is projected to be $58 billion in aggregate.

Pre-provision Net Revenue

Pre-tax net income also includes projections of post-stress income and expenses captured in pre-

provision net revenue (PPNR). Over the projection horizon, banks are projected to generate an

aggregate of $469 billion in PPNR, which is equal to 2.3 percent of their combined average assets

(see table 7).

PPNR projections are generally driven by the shape of the yield curve, the path of asset prices,

equity market volatility, and measures of economic activity in the severely adverse scenario. In

addition, PPNR incorporates expenses stemming from operational-risk events, such as fraud,

employee lawsuits, litigation-related expenses, or computer system or other operating disrup-

16 Only banks subject to Category I or II standards or banks that opt in are required to include unrealized gains and losses
on AFS debt securities in the calculation of capital. Category III and IV banks are not required to include unrealized gains
and losses on AFS debt securities in the calculation of capital.

24

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

tions.17 In the aggregate, operational-risk losses are $179 billion for the 22 banks in the 2025

stress test. This amount is slightly lower than the $182 billion projected for the same set of banks

in the 2024 stress test.

The ratio of PPNR to average assets varies across banks (see figure 10), primarily because of dif-

ferences in business focus. For instance, the ratio of PPNR to assets tends to be higher at banks

focusing on credit card lending, since credit cards generally produce higher net interest income
relative to other forms of lending.18 Additionally, lower ratios of PPNR to assets do not necessarily

imply lower pre-tax net income, because the same business focus and risk characteristics deter-

mining differences in PPNR across banks could also result in offsetting projected losses.

17 These operational-risk expenses are not a supervisory estimate of banks’ current or expected legal liability, as they are
conditional on the severely adverse scenario and conservative assumptions, and they also incorporate the potential for
substantial losses that do not involve litigation or legal exposure.

18 Credit card lending also tends to generate relatively high loss rates, suggesting that the higher PPNR rates at these

banks do not necessarily indicate higher profitability.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results

Box 2. Summary of Results of Exploratory Analysis of Risks to
Banking System

As a companion to the 2025 supervisory stress test, the Federal Reserve conducted an exploratory
analysis. This analysis complements the stress test by providing aggregate banking system results
against different economic and financial conditions. The exploratory analysis is distinct from the stress
test and does not affect large bank capital requirements.

This year’s exploratory analysis consists of two elements.1 The first element examines credit and
liquidity shocks in the nonbank financial institution (NBFI) sector during a severe global recession.2 The
second element is an exploratory market shock featuring a sudden dislocation to financial markets
stemming from expectations of reduced global economic activity and higher inflation expectations.3

Results of Nonbank Financial Institution Stress Analysis

The NBFI stress is motivated by rapid growth in large bank credit commitments to NBFIs over the past
five years, which reached about $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2024 at large banks.4 While total
loans at large banks increased by 21 percent over this period, lending to NBFIs at large banks has
grown by 56 percent. This rapid growth poses risks to banks, as certain NBFIs operate with high
leverage and are dependent on funding from the banking sector.

The NBFI stress analysis features a credit component and a liquidity component:

• The credit component assumes rapid deterioration in the credit quality of assets held by highly lever-
aged NBFIs, leading to downgrades in their own credit ratings.5 The analysis assumes that each bor-
rower in these sub-sectors is downgraded by one credit rating grade (for example, from A to BBB) at
the beginning of the stress horizon.

• The liquidity component assumes certain NBFIs draw more heavily on their lines of credit with

banks.6 These sub-sectors have historically relied more heavily on the banks’ lines of credit in times
of stress. This component assumes that borrowers in these two sub-sectors would draw 100 per-
cent of their available undrawn line of credit.

1 For more information on the parameters for the exploratory analysis, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

Exploratory Analysis of Risks to the Banking System (Washington: Board of Governors, February 2025), https://
www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/exploratory-analysis-of-risks-to-the-banking-system-20250205.pdf.

2 This element applies to all 22 banks subject to the supervisory stress test.
3 This element applies only to the eight U.S. globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation

and State Street Corporation were only subject to the hedge fund counterparty default components of the exploratory market
shocks; the results do not include mark-to-market losses on their trading or credit valuation adjustments exposures. The exploratory
market shocks are applied to positions held by the banks on October 11, 2024.

4 See figure 3.15 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of Governors,

April 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20250425.pdf.

5 The sub-sectors are: (1) private equity, business development companies, and credit funds; (2) broker-dealers; and (3) special

purpose entities, collateralized loan obligations, and asset-backed securities.

6 The sub-sectors are real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other financial vehicles. Other financial vehicles includes hedge funds;

closed-end funds; and firms engaged in financial planning, investment management, and pension management activities,
among others.

Results for Banks under the Severely Adverse Scenario

27

Box 2—continued

The results of the NBFI stress analysis suggest that the banking system is able to withstand the addi-
tional credit and liquidity stress to selected NBFI sub-sectors included in the exploratory analysis.
Under NBFI stress, the aggregate CET1 capital ratio is projected to fall by 1.6 percentage points to a
minimum of 11.9 percent.1 Through the nine-quarter projection, total loan losses are estimated around
$490 billion.

Both the credit and liquidity components of the NBFI stress increase loan loss projections. Over the
projection horizon, the credit component increases the loss rate on the loans subject to the credit com-
ponent by about 3 percentage points on average, while the liquidity component increases the loss rate
on the set of loans subject to the liquidity component by about 1.5 percentage points on average. The
projected loss rates vary across sub-sectors depending on the risk characteristics of the underlying
loans (see figure A). The overall loss rate on loans to financial institutions under the NBFI stress is
around 7 percent.

This exploratory analysis shows that large banks are generally well-positioned to withstand significant
additional credit and liquidity stresses to major categories of NBFI lending exposures. The resilience of
individual banks to these additional stresses depends on their exposures to the sub-sectors subjected
to the credit and liquidity components and, for those subject to the credit component, the starting dis-
tribution of credit ratings of those borrowers.

Box 2—continued

Results of Exploratory Market Shock Analysis

The exploratory market shock is characterized by a sudden dislocation to financial markets stemming
from expectations of reduced global economic activity and higher inflation expectations.1 A separate
add-on component tests the results of equity market dislocations on large banks’ counterparty expo-
sures to hedge funds. This component applies stresses to valuations of single-name U.S. equity expo-
sures held by hedge fund counterparties.2 Hedge funds unable to meet margin calls are assumed to be
forced to liquidate equity positions at a loss; the five hedge funds with the largest counterparty expo-
sures for each bank are assumed to fail.

The results of the exploratory market shock element suggest that the largest and most complex banks
can withstand a market shock stemming from higher inflation expectations. Under the exploratory
market shock scenario, trading losses at U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are
expected to be about $17 billion. Aggregate losses from the assumed default of the hedge funds are
moderate, amounting to roughly $8 billion.

The purpose of the market shock element is to assess the resilience of the largest and most complex
banks to a wider variety of shocks. Despite significant variation in the performance of certain asset
classes, results show that banks are well positioned against various potential outcomes, particularly in
their trading books. Additionally, the largest and most complex banks demonstrated manageable expo-
sure to single-name equity risk at hedge fund counterparties.

1 A shock of -20 percent is applied to U.S. equities.
2 To represent the potential for further stress in concentrated positions that large banks finance at their hedge fund clients, long

single-name equity positions receive a shock of -35 percent, while short single-name equity positions receive a shock of -10 percent.

Large Bank Capital Requirements

August 2025

Background

The Federal Reserve promotes a safe, sound, and efficient banking system that supports the U.S.

economy through its supervision and regulation of domestic and foreign banks.

As part of its supervision efforts, the Federal Reserve annually conducts a supervisory stress

test. The stress test assesses how large banks are likely to perform under hypothetical economic
conditions.1 Figure 1 summarizes the stress test cycle.

Figure 1. How stress testing works for large banks

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to ensure that large banks are sufficiently capitalized and able to lend to
households and businesses even in a severe recession. The stress tests evaluate the financial resilience of banks by
estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital levels under hypothetical economic conditions.

1 At times, Federal Reserve staff engage staff from banks subject to the stress test to better understand the submitted
bank data and make adjustments, if needed.

1 U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), covered savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs), and intermediate holding

companies of foreign banking organizations (IHCs) with $100 billion or more in assets are subject to the Federal Reserve
Board’s supervisory stress test rules (12 CFR pt. 238, subpt. O; pt. 252, subpt. E) and capital planning requirements
(12 CFR §§ 225.8; 238.170).

Large Bank Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to help ensure that large banks are sufficiently capital-

ized and able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. The stress tests

evaluate the financial resilience of banks by estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting

capital levels under hypothetical economic conditions.

As part of the annual supervisory stress test cycle, the Federal Reserve publishes four

documents:

• Stress Test Scenarios describes the hypothetical economic conditions used in the supervisory

stress test. The Stress Test Scenarios document has typically been published by mid-February.

• Supervisory Stress Test Methodology provides details about the models and methodologies used

in the supervisory stress test.

• Federal Reserve Stress Test Results reports the aggregate and individual bank results of the

supervisory stress test, which assesses whether banks are sufficiently capitalized to absorb

losses during a hypothetical severe recession. The Federal Reserve Stress Test Results docu-

ment is typically published at the end of the second quarter.

• Large Bank Capital Requirements announces the finalized individual capital requirements for all

large banks, which are partially informed by the results of a supervisory stress test. The Large

Bank Capital Requirements document is typically published during the third quarter.

These publications can be found on the Stress Test Publications page (https://

www.federalreserve.gov/publications/dodd-frank-act-stress-test-publications.htm).

For information on the Federal Reserve’s supervision of large financial institutions, see https://

www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/large-financial-institutions.htm.

the banking system, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg.htm.

Capital Requirements

Capital Requirements

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital framework for bank holding companies, covered savings

and loan holding companies, and U.S. intermediate holding companies with $100 billion or more

in total consolidated assets, capital requirements are partially informed by the results of a super-
visory stress test.2 Table 1 shows each large bank’s total common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital

ratio requirement, which is made up of several components, including

• a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5 percent, which is the same for each bank;

• the stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement, which is determined, in part, based on the results

of a supervisory stress test and is at least 2.5 percent;3 and

• if applicable, a capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), which is at

least 1.0 percent.

In April of this year, the Board proposed a rule to average the stress test results over two consecu-
tive years for certain banks to reduce the volatility in capital requirements.4 The Board is currently

reviewing and considering the comments received on the proposal. If the Board finalizes the rule

as proposed, it would require averaging this year’s results with those of the 2024 stress test to

calculate the SCB requirement for the banks that participated in the 2025 stress test.

2 Firms subject to Category IV standards are generally not required to participate in the supervisory stress test in years
ending in an odd number. The firms that did not participate in this year’s supervisory stress test have stress capital
buffer requirements based on 2024 supervisory stress test results and that have been adjusted by the Federal Reserve
Board pursuant to 12 CFR § 225.8(f)(4) and 12 CFR § 238.170(f)(4).

3 See 12 CFR §§ 225.8(f) and 238.170(f) for rules on the SCB requirement calculation and 2025 Federal Reserve Stress
Test Results (Washington: Board of Governors, June 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-
dfast-results-20250627.pdf for details on the 2025 supervisory stress test results.

Subject: Response to request for reconsideration of Morgan Stanley’s preliminary stress capital 
buffer requirement, pursuant to the Board’s capital plan rules

Dear Mr. Pick: 

This letter is in response to the request by Morgan Stanley for reconsideration of the 

preliminary stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement provided to Morgan Stanley by the Board 
on June 27, 2025.1  For the reasons stated below, the Board has modified the preliminary SCB
requirement previously provided to Morgan Stanley from 5.1 percent to 4.3 percent.  With 
respect to the request for an informal hearing in connection with the request for reconsideration, 
the Board has not ordered an informal hearing.  In connection with these actions, the Board has 
extended, until October 3, 2025, the deadline to provide Morgan Stanley with its final SCB 
requirement.

I. Background

The Board’s capital plan rules establish the process for determining an SCB

requirement.2  Pursuant to the rules, the Board generally will provide a firm with notice of its 
preliminary SCB requirement by June 30 of each year in which the firm submits an annual

dated September 26, 2025 (“September 26 Letter”). This letter, which makes technical 
corrections to the September 26 Letter, supersedes that document.

capital plan.3  On June 27, the Board provided Morgan Stanley with notice of a preliminary SCB 
requirement for 2025 of 5.1 percent.4  

The capital plan rules permit a firm to request reconsideration of the preliminary SCB 

requirement within 15 calendar days of receiving notice thereof.5  A firm may include a request 
for an informal hearing on the firm’s request for reconsideration.6  Morgan Stanley requested an 
extension of time until July 14, 2025, to request reconsideration, and the Secretary of the Board, 
acting under delegated authority from the Board, granted the request. 7  

Morgan Stanley requested reconsideration of its preliminary SCB requirement on July 14, 

including a request for an informal hearing.  The capital plan rules generally provide that the 
Board will notify a firm of the Board’s decision to affirm or modify the firm’s SCB requirement 
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the firm’s request for reconsideration, or within 30 days of 
the conclusion of an informal hearing regarding such a request.8  Morgan Stanley has requested 
that the Board suspend, until September 26, the time period for action by the Board under 
section 225.8(i)(5) of Regulation Y.9 

In each year in which a firm submits an annual capital plan, the Board generally will 

provide the firm with a final SCB requirement, as well as confirmation of the firm’s final 
planned capital distributions for that year, by August 31.10  Due to the request for 
reconsideration, the Board has extended, until October 3, 2025, the deadline to provide Morgan 
Stanley with its final SCB requirement.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the final 
planned capital distributions and final SCB requirement for a given year become effective 
October 1 of that year.11  An SCB requirement that becomes effective will remain effective until 
superseded.12

II.  Stress Testing Framework 

The SCB requirement is based, in part, on the results of a supervisory stress test 
conducted by the Board.  Specifically, a firm’s SCB requirement is the greater of 2.5 percent or 
the following calculation:  (1) the difference between the firm’s starting and minimum projected 
common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in a 
supervisory stress test conducted by the Board plus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of the firm’s 
planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning 
horizon13 as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.14  The SCB requirement provided to Morgan 
Stanley on June 27 was calculated based on 2025 supervisory stress test results released by the 
Board.15 

The results of the Board’s supervisory stress tests are projected using a set of models 
developed or selected by the Federal Reserve that take as inputs (1) the supervisory scenarios 
created by the Federal Reserve and (2) firm-provided data on the firm’s financial condition and 
risk characteristics.  The Board has adopted two statements of policy to provide firms and the 
public with transparency regarding the stress tests.  The Board’s Scenario Design Policy 
Statement outlines the process through which the Board develops the macroeconomic scenarios 
and additional scenario components for the company-run and supervisory stress tests,16 and the 
Stress Testing Policy Statement describes the principles, policies, and procedures that guide the 
development, implementation, and validation of the models used in the supervisory stress test.17  
Consistent with the principles described in the Stress Testing Policy Statement, the Federal 
Reserve designed the system of models so they would result in projections that are (1) from an 
independent supervisory perspective; (2) forward-looking; (3) consistent and comparable across 
covered companies; (4) generated from simple approaches, where appropriate; (5) robust and 
stable; (6) conservative; and (7) able to capture the effect of economic stress.18  

13  The planning horizon is the period of at least nine consecutive quarters over which the 
relevant projections extend, beginning with the quarter preceding the quarter in which the firm 
submits its capital plan.

The Federal Reserve’s models rely on detailed portfolio data provided by firms but 

generally do not rely on models or estimates provided by firms, consistent with the modeling 
principle that emphasizes an independent perspective. 

The Federal Reserve generally develops its models under an industry-level approach that 

is calibrated using data from many financial institutions.  This approach reflects modeling 
principles that favor models resulting in consistent, comparable, and forward-looking 
projections.  The Federal Reserve models the response of specific portfolios and instruments to 
variations in macroeconomic and financial-scenario variables such that differences across firms 
are driven by differences in firm-specific input data, as opposed to differences in model 
parameters and specifications.  As a result, two firms with the same portfolio receive the same 
results for that portfolio in the supervisory stress test, facilitating the comparability of results.  In 
addition, the industry-level approach promotes a forward-looking stress test, as it results in 
models that do not assume that historical patterns will necessarily continue into the future for 
individual firms.  These policies also help to ensure that consistent and comparable supervisory 
models are forward-looking, robust, and stable.19 

III. Discussion 

As required by the Board’s capital plan rules, Morgan Stanley’s request for 

reconsideration of its preliminary SCB requirement included a detailed explanation of why it 
contends that reconsideration should be granted.20  Morgan Stanley also submitted supplemental 
information related to its reconsideration request on September 3, 2025 (the Supplement).  The 
Board is not required to consider arguments that are not discussed in a firm’s initial request for 

19  While the Federal Reserve limits the use of firm-specific fixed effects and the use of dummy 
variables indicating a loan vintage or specific year, it makes exceptions where appropriate.  For 
example, the Federal Reserve may use firm-specific indicator variables, firm-provided estimates, 
or third-party models or data in instances in which it is not possible or appropriate to create a 
supervisory model for use in the stress test, including when supervisory data are insufficient to 
support an independently modeled estimate of losses or revenues.  However, the Federal Reserve 
does not adjust supervisory projections for individual firms or implement firm-specific overlays 
in the supervisory stress test.  This policy ensures that the supervisory stress test results are 
determined solely by supervisory models and firm-specific input data.  The Federal Reserve has 
instituted a policy of not using additional input data submitted by one or more of the covered 
companies unless comparable data can be collected from all the firms that have material 
exposure in a given area.  12 CFR part 252, Appendix B, at 2.8.

reconsideration.21  In this case, the Board has evaluated the arguments in the Supplement and has 
discretion to consider them in its assessment of the reconsideration request. 

To ensure that review of Morgan Stanley’s request would be conducted with an 

independent perspective, a group of experts within the Federal Reserve System—who are 
independent of the staff responsible for developing and running the stress test models and 
providing firms with their preliminary SCB requirements—analyzed the arguments made by 
Morgan Stanley in favor of reconsideration of its preliminary SCB requirement.22  With respect 
to each of the issues raised in the request by Morgan Stanley, the experts considered all aspects 
of the request, including, among other things, whether the request pointed to any errors in the 
firm’s stress test results (including whether the input data to the stress test was treated 
appropriately) and whether each stress test model identified in the firm’s request is operating as 
intended, within the bounds of the Board’s published policies.  The information in this letter 
regarding the Board’s stress testing policies and supervisory modeling practices was previously 
publicly disclosed, consistent with the Board’s practice to increase the transparency of the stress 
testing program.23 

As discussed above, Morgan Stanley’s request for reconsideration included a request for 

an informal hearing.  The Board has determined not to grant Morgan Stanley’s request for an 
informal hearing regarding its request for reconsideration.24  The informal hearing process is 
intended to ensure that a firm is able to present its arguments to the Federal Reserve and to 
provide an opportunity for both the firm and the Federal Reserve to ask any questions regarding 
the request, including questions regarding disputed issues of material fact.  Federal Reserve staff 
has met with representatives from Morgan Stanley several times to discuss the request for 
reconsideration.  The firm described its arguments for reconsideration in the meetings, and both 
the firm and Federal Reserve staff had the opportunity to ask questions orally and in written 
format.  In light of these circumstances and because there are no outstanding disputed issues of 

21  See 12 CFR 225.8(i)(3)(i) (stating that a request for reconsideration must include a detailed 
explanation of the reasons why reconsideration should be granted). 
22  This group is composed of staff members from across the Federal Reserve System who are 
subject-matter experts and are not involved in supervisory modeling.  This group’s model 
validation process includes reviews of model performance; conceptual soundness; and the 
processes, procedures, and controls used in model development, implementation, and the 
production of results.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2025 Supervisory 
Stress Test Methodology at 5–6 (June 2025), available at

methodology.pdf.

order an informal hearing).

material fact,25 the Board has not ordered an informal hearing regarding Morgan Stanley’s 
request.  

In its request, Morgan Stanley argued that (1) its compensation expenses were overstated 

because the Federal Reserve did not sufficiently account for the mechanical decline in its 
variable compensation expenses during economic downturns; (2) noninterest expense projections 
should be adjusted downward to reflect declines in the firm’s volume-driven, transaction-related 
expenses and discretionary spending during economic stress; (3) operational risk modeling 
should use firm characteristics, not firm asset size, to proxy for financial risk; (4) trading losses 
were double-counted in the projections of trading mark-to-market losses and PPNR 

; (5) the stress test results implausibly overestimated the firm’s losses in the 

“other losses / gains” category and inappropriately frontloaded these losses 

; (6) the Federal Reserve misstated the firm’s quarterly tax expense by incorrectly 
applying the change in valuation allowance; (7) the LCPD recovery rate, which is assumed to be 
10 percent for all firms, should vary based on a firm’s largest counterparty and exposure type; 
(8) the exclusion of private equity shocks but not private equity hedges from the GMS 
component in 2025 benefited firms 
Federal Reserve’s use of the GMS scenario given the atypical trading positions of some firms on 
the GMS as-of date produced “arbitrary and capricious” results; and (10)

(11) the PPNR projections of wealth management and asset management revenues are 
inaccurately calibrated using macroeconomic variable sensitivities from industry-wide 
investment banking data; (12) the stress test’s interest rate expense projections do not account for 
Morgan Stanley’s floating rate liability mix, which would result in lower expenses as rates 
decline; (13) the Board may have overestimated trading stress losses by using an approach that 
may not fully capture the complexities of the underlying assets in its calculation of trading MtM 
losses and inappropriately including private equity positions in the projection of trading issuer 
default losses (IDL) despite the exclusion of private equity shocks from the GMS component; 
and (14) loss projections for “Other Loans” should assign de minimis loss rates to Morgan 
Stanley’s

As discussed in detail below, with respect to Morgan Stanley’s fifth and seventh 
arguments, the Board determined that the models at issue did not function correctly to generate

- 7 - 

stressed projections that appropriately reflect the firm’s risk profile, warranting modifications to 
the firm’s SCB requirement.  However, with respect to Morgan Stanley’s other arguments, the 
Board did not identify any errors in Morgan Stanley’s stress test results and has determined that 
the models operated as intended, within the bounds of the Board’s published policies.  

1.  Compensation-related expenses 

Morgan Stanley argued that the Federal Reserve overstated the firm’s compensation-

related expenses because the PPNR model did not account for financial advisor variable 
compensation, deferred cash-based compensation, or carried interest compensation, all of which, 
the firm asserts, would decline automatically during economic downturns under the contractual 
terms governing these expenses. 

Specifically, Morgan Stanley argued that the structure of its financial advisor variable 

compensation program would reduce its total compensation expenses under stress.  According to 
the firm, these advisors, who are employed in the firm’s wealth management business line, are 
compensated according to a standardized, fixed formula that ties compensation to identifiable 
revenues.  Morgan Stanley argued that a severe economic downturn, as reflected in the stress 
test’s severely adverse scenario, would reduce client asset valuations and related revenues, and 
thus, lead to an associated reduction in financial advisor compensation.  In its 2025 projections, 
Morgan Stanley estimated that decreased compensation for financial advisors would result in a 
 reduction in its total compensation expenses.  As part of the release of 2024 stress 
test results, the Federal Reserve had announced it would implement material model adjustments 
to account for the sensitivity of variable commission-based compensation to deteriorations in 
economic conditions and would phase in such changes over two stress test cycles, as is required 
for material model adjustments.26  Morgan Stanley did not believe these adjustments were 
sufficient and, further, asked that any such adjustments be implemented in full for the 2025 stress 
test, in anticipation of implementation of the Board’s proposed rulemaking to average SCB 
requirements over two years.  

Morgan Stanley also argued that its projected compensation expenses should be lower 

due to the structure of its deferred cash-based compensation programs (DCPs).  The firm 
represented that it sponsors several DCPs through which current and former employees may 
allocate deferred compensation awards among a preselected set of notional investments.  The 
firm then hedges resulting market exposures through direct investments; consequently, changes 
in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of investments are generally 
offset by changes in the fair value of related hedged investments in net revenues.  Morgan 
Stanley argued that, during an economic downturn that produces declining asset values, related

- 8 - 

compensation expenses would similarly decrease.  The firm estimated that, for the 2025 stress 
test, its compensation expenses should have been approximately 

 lower 

 of the severely adverse scenario due to the structure of its DCPs. 

Finally, Morgan Stanley argued that its carried interest compensation program would also 

result in declines in compensation expenses in adverse economic conditions.  The firm stated 
that, as the general partner of certain investment funds, it is compensated through carried interest 
performance fee revenue, which is earned when fund performance exceeds a contractual 
performance benchmark.  In turn, fund management employees at Morgan Stanley may 
participate in carried interest compensation plans, which determine compensation using fund-
specific, formulaic percentages of carried interest revenues.  Therefore, the firm asserts, during a 
downturn that results in declining asset valuations, the value of accrued carried interest would 
decrease, resulting in a corresponding decline in compensation liability.  While the firm 
acknowledged that the Federal Reserve made changes to project losses on private equity 
exposures in the macroeconomic scenario, rather than the GMS component of the 2025 stress 
test, it argued that these changes failed to capture the offsetting reduction in related 
compensation liability.  The firm estimated that carried interest compensation dynamics should 
have lowered its compensation expenses by 

 in the 2025 stress test. 

The PPNR model was used to project Morgan Stanley’s compensation-related expenses.  

This aspect of the PPNR model was developed using a statistical regression approach based on 
historic compensation behaviors across multiple firms.  The approach does not account for the 
planned or predetermined actions of individual firms during a downturn.  The estimation data 
does not distinguish between variable and fixed compensation expenses and includes firms with 
different compensation strategies and variable compensation usage.  To account for potential 
differences in sensitivity of the variable pay cash component of compensation to the 
macroeconomic scenarios, an overlay adjustment was utilized starting in 2024 to reduce each 
firm’s compensation expense.  For purposes of the 2025 stress test projections, the Federal 
Reserve expanded this adjustment to include commissions, and stated that the expanded 
adjustment would be phased in over the 2025 and 2026 stress test cycle.27     

The Board determined that the PPNR model functioned as intended to produce 
projections of Morgan Stanley’s compensation expenses and that there were no errors in the 
calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB 
requirement based on these arguments.   

27  2025 Supervisory Stress Test Methodology at 95.  As described in the Stress Testing Policy 
Statement, highly material changes to the supervisory stress test models are phased in over two 
years to reduce year-over-year volatility stemming from updates to the supervisory models.  
See 12 CFR part 252, Appendix B, at 2.3.

2.  Non-compensation-related expenses 

Morgan Stanley argued that the 2025 stress test overestimated its non-compensation-
related expenses by inappropriately holding noninterest expense projections constant in the 
severely adverse scenario.  Morgan Stanley represented that its transaction-related expenses (e.g., 
brokerage, clearing, and execution and other volume-driven, noninterest expenses) would decline 
in periods of economic stress due to lower transaction and execution volumes.  Morgan Stanley 
also argued that its discretionary spending, 

, would similarly decline.  The firm estimated that it would reduce spending on 

scenario. 

of the severely adverse 

These expenses were projected within the Noninterest Expense (NIE) PPNR component.  

Because this component does not exhibit clear and stable relationships with macroeconomic 
conditions the model is constructed as an eight-quarter median to capture the firm’s recent actual 
expense behavior and trends.  The model was not intended to capture movements in expenses 
directly related to the macroeconomic environment as asserted by the firm.  The Board 
determined that the NIE PPNR model functioned as intended to produce projections of Morgan 
Stanley’s non-compensation-related expenses and that there were no errors in the calculation.  
Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB requirement based on 
this argument. 

3.  Operational losses 

Morgan Stanley asserted that the Federal Reserve overstated the firm’s operational risk 
losses and did not account for its business mix or internal controls.  The firm contended that the 
Board’s use of total assets as a proxy for operational risk in regression and historical simulation 
models overstated the firm’s projected losses.  Morgan Stanley observes that, in the 2025 
supervisory stress test, the industry ratio of projected operational risk losses to assets was 
0.88 percent, and argued that this loss rate assumption was inappropriate for the firm, which had 
an actual operational loss-to-asset ratio of 

2025 supervisory stress test were approximately 
firm. 

.  Overall, the firm’s projected operational risk losses in the 
 higher than losses projected by the 

The Operational Risk models rely on a combination of industry operational loss 
experiences and firms’ total assets.  The Federal Reserve uses total assets as a key driver of loss 
projections in the Operational Risk model based on observed loss patterns over a long historical 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 10 - 

period.  Because the models are constructed at an industry level, the models are not intended to 
explicitly capture each firm’s business mix and internal controls.   

The Board determined that the Operational Risk model functioned as intended to produce 

projections of Morgan Stanley’s operational risk losses and that there were no errors in the 
calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB 
requirement based on this argument. 

4.  Trading mark-to-market losses and PPNR 

Morgan Stanley contended that the Federal Reserve double-counted the firm’s trading 

losses across the mark-to-market loss in the GMS calculation and the PPNR calculation.  
Specifically, the firm argued that the same projected trading losses associated with its Fixed 
Income Division flowed through both the mark-to-market loss and PPNR models and were 
overly weighted in mark-to-market losses.  Morgan Stanley represented that correcting the 
alleged double-count would increase the firm’s fixed income trading revenue by 
more 

 of its 2025 stress test results. 

 or 

The Board assessed the projections of trading losses produced by the PPNR trading 
revenue model and the trading mark-to-market loss from the GMS.  While the GMS may project 
certain losses that are also captured in the PPNR trading revenue model, it is consistent with the 
stated purpose to stress positions separately from the macroeconomic scenario.  The GMS 
component is intended as an “exogenous” component of the supervisory stress test that is 
“independent of the macroeconomic and financial market environments” in the supervisory 
stress scenarios.28  The GMS can be considered as an additive rather than as a complementary 
component that may compound or lessen the stresses introduced in the macroeconomic 
scenario.29   

The Board determined that the GMS component and PPNR trading revenue model 
functioned as intended to produce projections of Morgan Stanley’s trading losses and that there 
were no errors in the calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s 
preliminary SCB requirement based on this argument.  

28  12 CFR part 252, Appendix B, at 2.5(a). 
29  For example, the market shock component “may not be always directionally consistent with 
the macroeconomic scenario.”  In particular, because the market shock aims to “mimic the 
effects of a sudden market dislocation, while the macroeconomic scenarios are designed to 
provide a description of the real economy over two or more years, assumed economic conditions 
can move in significantly different ways.” 12 CFR part 252, Appendix A, at 6(b). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 11 - 

5.  Other losses/gains 

Morgan Stanley argued that the 2025 stress test results overstated the firm’s calculated 

losses in the “other losses / gains” category, which reflects losses on held-for-sale and fair value 
option loans, and overallocated these losses 

.  The firm stated that 

 of the firm’s estimated losses in “other losses /gains,” projected by the Federal Reserve 

, were attributable to these positions, and that this amount was 
 higher than the firm’s projections using the same scenario-specific credit spread 

stresses.  The firm asserted that, based on its understanding of the Federal Reserve’s models, this 
result would require a credit spread widening that is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the 
highest intra-quarter widening value observed in historical data. 

Due to the LGD and LEQ assumptions and the unique composition of Morgan Stanley’s 

FVO loan portfolio, estimated losses were disproportionately frontloaded in the projection 
horizon.  Therefore, the Board determined that the model was unable to generate stressed 
projections that aligned with the stated purposes of the model, and as a result, the FVO loan 
model did not function correctly to generate stressed projections that appropriately reflect the 
firm’s risk profile.  The Board adjusted the treatment of Morgan Stanley’s FVO portfolio in the 
2025 supervisory stress test by adopting lower LGD and LEQ assumptions, which are calibrated 
to historical data from the firm and across large banks and reflective of stressed loss experience.  
The Board took this adjustment into account in modifying Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB 
requirement. 

6.  Taxation-related projections, inclusive of valuation allowance 

Morgan Stanley argued in its reconsideration request that the Federal Reserve misstated 

the firm’s quarterly tax expense by incorrectly applying changes to the deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance, which is comprised of a calculation that evaluates whether a firm will have 
sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets.  The firm represented that the Federal 
Reserve appeared to have used pre-tax book income rather than taxable income adjusted for 
allowance for loan losses and private equity losses to calculate sufficient income over the next 
year.  Morgan Stanley asserted that the correct calculation of quarterly tax expense would have 
provided the firm with sufficient taxable income to realize more of its deferred tax assets and 
would result in an approximately 

 higher tax provision benefit.   

The capital calculator model used taxable income to generate the change in the valuation 
allowance.  Consistent with the methodology disclosure, the Federal Reserve calculates taxable 
income as PPNR less credit losses on held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities, net 
charge-offs on loans measured at amortized cost, and other losses, including trading and 
counterparty losses and losses on held-for-sale and fair-value option loans.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
- 12 - 

The Board determined that the capital calculation model functioned as intended to 
produce projections of Morgan Stanley’s quarterly tax expense and that there were no errors in 
the calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB 
requirement based on this argument. 

7.  Largest Counterparty Default recovery rate assumption 

Morgan Stanley argued that the Federal Reserve’s assumption of a 10 percent recovery 

rate when calculating LCPD losses was inappropriate and that the assigned recovery rate should 
vary according to counterparty type and exposure type.  In particular, Morgan Stanley stated that 
the 10 percent recovery rate was miscalibrated given the credit profile of its largest counterparty 
in the 2025 stress test and the nature of the firm’s exposures.  In the Supplement, Morgan 
Stanley further argued that the Board should apply a higher recovery rate to a firm whose largest 
counterparty is 

. 

The Largest Counterparty Default model is consistently applied across all firms, 
including through its assumption of a 10 percent recovery rate following the default of the firm’s 
largest counterparty.  The 10 percent LCPD recovery rate assumption is generated from an 
estimate of a potential stressed recovery rate for an undiversified credit exposure under severe 
market conditions.30  The LCPD model “seeks to ensure that covered companies can absorb 
losses associated with the default of any counterparty,” and, as such, assumes a conservative 
LCPD recovery rate.31   

The Largest Counterparty Default model of the stress test excludes certain sovereign 

entities (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), 
certain multinational development banks and supranational entities (International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Bank for International 
Settlements, European Commission, and European Central Bank), and qualifying central 
counterparties from the selection of a firm’s largest counterparty.   

The Board evaluated whether it was appropriate to include the largest counterparty of 
Morgan Stanley in the Largest Counterparty Default Model.  The Board has determined that it 
would have been more consistent with the purpose of the model to exclude the largest 
counterparty of Morgan Stanley given the similarity to the counterparties discussed above.  The 
Board, therefore, has determined that the model was unable to generate stressed projections that 
aligned with the stated purposes of the model, and as a result, the Largest Counterparty Default

- 13 - 

model did not function correctly to generate stressed projections that appropriately reflect the 
firm’s risk profile.  Accordingly, the Board adjusted the Largest Counterparty Default model by 
excluding Morgan Stanley’s largest counterparty and instead considering its next-largest 
counterparty to be the largest counterparty for purposes of that component.  The Board took this 
adjustment into account in modifying Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB requirement.   

8–10. Private Equity-related data reporting; Positioning in the trading book; 

Morgan Stanley raises three additional arguments.  First, Morgan Stanley argued that it 

may have received higher losses relative to other firms in the 2025 stress test in part because of a 
change in the treatment of private equity shocks and hedges.  The firm stated that the Federal 
Reserve excluded private equity shocks from the GMS component in the 2025 stress test but did 
not remove related private equity hedges.  As a consequence of this change, firms 

 may have benefited because their hedges received GMS 
treatment, resulting in larger gains, while these same firms’ private equity positions received 
lower losses. 

Second, Morgan Stanley argued that the Board’s use of a GMS scenario that benefited 

certain firms with atypical trading positions on the GMS as-of date produced “arbitrary and 
capricious” outcomes.  According to the firm, while the Board did not have trading book 
portfolio data when it announced the GMS as-of date, it did have this data when it published the 
GMS scenario, creating “‘winners and losers’ ... based on the variable composition and 
directionality of each institution’s trading portfolio.”  Morgan Stanley asserts that its results 
misstate its risk profile, relative to its peers, and are, therefore, arbitrary and capricious.  

With respect to these three arguments, Morgan Stanley does not assert that the challenged 

aspects of the 2025 stress test affected the calculation of the preliminary SCB requirement 
provided to the firm on June 27.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s SCB 
requirement in response to these arguments.32   

32  See 12 CFR 225.8(i)(3)(i); 12 CFR 238.170(i)(3)(i). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 14 - 

Nonetheless, the Board assessed each of these arguments, and has determined that 

Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB requirement was calculated correctly and that the models 
implicated by these arguments functioned correctly, in a manner consistent with the Board’s 
published policies and public Methodology Disclosure. 

11. Wealth and investment management revenue projections  

In the Supplement, Morgan Stanley asserted that the Board uses macroeconomic variable 

sensitivities derived using investment banking revenues to project revenue for its wealth and 
investment management activities.  Morgan Stanley argued that, because investment banking 
revenues are significantly more volatile than wealth or investment management revenues, the use 
of these macroeconomic sensitivities resulted in an underestimate of Morgan Stanley’s revenue. 

Projections for noninterest income from investment banking revenues were generated 

using the Investment Banking Fees model.  For large firms, noninterest income from investment 
banking fees is modeled in aggregate and is projected using an autoregressive model 
specification that includes macroeconomic variables, seasonality indicators, and firm-specific 
fixed effects.   

The Board determined that the Investment Banking Fees model functioned as intended to 

produce projections of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management and investment management 
revenues, and that there were no errors in the calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify 
Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB requirement based on this argument. 

12. Interest expense projections 

Morgan Stanley argued in the Supplement that the Board overestimated its interest 

expenses in the stress test because it did not account for the composition of Morgan Stanley’s 
interest rate liabilities.  Specifically, Morgan Stanley argued that, because 
interest rate liabilities are floating rate liabilities, declines in interest rates would also result in a 
decrease in interest rate expenses. 

 of its 

Projections for interest expenses were generated using the PPNR interest expense models, 

which include six components.33  The Board determined that the PPNR interest expense models 
functioned as intended to produce projections of Morgan Stanley’s portfolio and that there were 

33  These components are (1) domestic time deposits, (2) federal funds and repurchase 
agreements, (3) foreign deposits, (4) other domestic deposits, (5) subordinated debt, and (6) 
trading liabilities, other borrowed money, and all other interest expenses. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 15 - 

no errors in the calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary 
SCB requirement based on this argument. 

13. MtM and IDL trading stress losses 

In the Supplement, Morgan Stanley argued that the Board overestimated its trading stress 

.  Morgan Stanley argued that the Board may have inaccurately calculated 

losses by 
trading MtM losses by using an approach that may not fully capture the complexities of the 
underlying assets in its calculation of trading MtM losses.  Morgan Stanley also argued that the 
Board may have overestimated its trading IDL losses by inappropriately including private equity 
positions in its trading IDL projections, despite the Board’s representation that private equity 
shocks would not be included in the 2025 GMS component. 

The trading MtM losses projections were generated using the Trading MtM model.  The 
Board also reviewed the manner in which the trading incremental default loss model treated the 
private equity positions reported by Morgan Stanley.  The Board determined that the trading 
MtM and IDL models functioned as intended to produce projections of Morgan Stanley’s 
portfolio and that there were no errors in the calculations.  Therefore, the Board did not modify 
Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB requirement based on this argument. 

14. Other loans 

Morgan Stanley argued in the Supplement that the Board overstated its losses from the 

“Other Loans” category by applying an inappropriately high loss rate.  In particular, Morgan 
Stanley represented that most of its “Other Loans” were comprised of

should be assigned de minimis loss rates even under severe stress.   

Morgan Stanley argued that these portfolios 

The Board determined that the wholesale model functioned as intended to produce 

projections of Morgan Stanley’s other loans losses and that there were no errors in the 
calculation.  Therefore, the Board did not modify Morgan Stanley’s preliminary SCB 
requirement based on this argument. 

IV. Conclusion 

After consideration of the Board’s stress testing policies and all relevant facts, including 
the information provided in the request, the Supplement, and other supervisory information, and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 16 - 

consistent with the Board’s regulations, the Board has modified the preliminary SCB 
requirement provided to Morgan Stanley, on June 27, 2025, from 5.1 percent to 4.3 percent.34   

The Board is focused on continually improving the stress testing framework, including 
the Board’s supervisory models.35  In December 2024, the Board issued a press release noting 
that it intends to seek public comment on changes to improve the transparency of the stress tests 
and reduce the volatility of the associated capital buffer requirements.36  Following the 
publication of the models, the Board will review any public comments received in order to 
consider further model improvements.   

The preliminary SCB requirement for Morgan Stanley is 4.3 percent.  By 

September 30, 2025, Morgan Stanley should notify the Board of any adjustments to its planned 
capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the 
internal baseline scenario.37  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the firm will be 
provided with its final SCB requirement and confirmation of its final planned capital 
distributions by October 3, 2025.

Federal financial institution regulatory agencies today remind lenders that they may continue to make loans that are subject to the federal flood insurance statutes when the National Flood Insurance Program is not available. During this period, lenders are allowed to make these loans without requiring federal flood insurance.

As explained in the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance , in Q&A Applicability 12, lenders may continue to make loans without flood insurance coverage during this time but must continue to make flood determinations; provide timely, complete, and accurate notices to borrowers; and comply with other applicable parts of the flood insurance regulations. In addition, lenders should evaluate safety and soundness and legal risks and should prudently manage those risks during the lapse period. The guidance also addresses the availability and use of private flood insurance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 

The National Flood Insurance Act of 

1968 created the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP), which is 
administered by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).1 The 
NFIP enables property owners in 
participating communities to purchase 
flood insurance if the community has 
adopted floodplain management 
ordinances and minimum standards for 
new and substantially damaged or 
improved construction. Thus, in 
participating communities, federally- 

1 Public Law 90–448, 82 Stat. 572 (1968). 

backed flood insurance is available for 
property owners in flood risk areas. 
Congress expanded the NFIP by 
enacting the Flood Disaster Protection 
Act of 1973 (FDPA).2 The FDPA made 
the purchase of flood insurance 
mandatory in connection with loans 
made by federally-regulated lending 
institutions when the loans are secured 
by improved real estate or mobile homes 
located in a special flood hazard area 
(SFHA). The National Flood Insurance 
Reform Act of 1994 (the Reform Act) 
(Title V of the Riegle Community 
Development and Regulatory 
Improvement Act of 1994) 
comprehensively revised the Federal 
flood insurance statutes.3 The Reform 
Act required the OCC, Board, FDIC, 
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and 
NCUA to revise their flood insurance 
regulations, and required the FCA to 
promulgate a flood insurance regulation 
for the first time. The OCC, Board, FDIC, 
OTS, FCA, and NCUA 4 fulfilled these 
requirements by issuing a joint final rule 
in the summer of 1996.5 

In October 2013, the Agencies jointly 

issued proposed rules 6 to implement 
the escrow, force placement, and private 
flood insurance provisions of the 
Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform 
Act of 2012 (the Biggert-Waters Act).7 In 
March 2014, Congress enacted the 
Homeowner Flood Insurance 
Affordability Act (HFIAA), which, 
among other things, amended the 
Biggert-Waters Act’s requirements 
regarding the escrow of flood insurance 
premiums and fees and created a new 
exemption from the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement for 
certain detached structures.8 The 
Agencies finalized the regulations to 
implement provisions in the Biggert- 
Waters Act and HFIAA under the 
Agencies’ jurisdiction, except for the 
provisions in the Biggert-Waters Act 
related to private flood insurance, with 
a final rule issued in July 2015 (2015 
Final Rule).9 In February 2019, the

includes the OTS with respect to events that 
occurred prior to July 21, 2011, but does not 
include OTS with respect to events thereafter. 
Sections 311 and 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act transferred 
OTS’s functions to other agencies on July 21, 2011. 
The OTS’s supervisory functions relating to Federal 
savings associations were transferred to the OCC, 
while those relating to State savings associations 
were transferred to the FDIC. See also 76 FR 39246

related provisions of the Biggert-Waters 
Act (2019 Final Rule).10 

Interagency Questions and Answers 
Regarding Flood Insurance 

Since 1997, the Interagency Questions 

and Answers 11 have provided the 
lending industry and other interested 
parties with guidance addressing a wide 
spectrum of technical flood insurance- 
related compliance issues. In 2009, the 
Agencies comprehensively revised and 
reorganized the initial 1997 Interagency 
Questions and Answers (2009 
Interagency Questions and Answers). In 
2011, the Agencies further finalized two 
additional Q&As that were proposed in 
2009, and re-proposed three Q&As that 
were never finalized.12 

In light of the significant changes to 
flood insurance requirements pursuant 
to the Biggert-Waters Act and HFIAA, as 
well as the Agencies’ regulations issued 
to implement these laws, the Agencies 
proposed new and revised Interagency 
Questions and Answers in July 2020 
(July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers) that covered a broad range of 
topics related to technical flood 
insurance-related issues, including the 
escrow of flood insurance premiums, 
the detached structure exemption to the 
mandatory purchase of flood insurance 
requirement, and force placement 
procedures.13 This proposal also 
reorganized the Interagency Questions 
and Answers to provide a more logical 
flow of questions through the flood 
insurance process. The Agencies also 
committed in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers to separately 
issuing for notice and comment 
additional proposed questions and 
answers relating to the 2019 Final Rule 
implementing the private flood 
insurance provisions of the Biggert- 
Waters Act. The Agencies published 
these proposed questions and answers 
in March 2021 (March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers).14 

private flood insurance provisions through a joint 
notice of proposed rulemaking (81 FR 78063). 

10 84 FR 4953 (Feb. 20, 2019). 
11 Throughout this document, ‘‘Interagency 
Questions and Answers’’ refers to the Interagency 
Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance 
in its entirety; ‘‘Q&A’’ refers to an individual 
question and answer within the Questions and 
Answers. 

12 For additional information on the history of the 
Interagency Questions and Answers, please see the 
preamble to the July 2020 Proposed Interagency 
Questions and Answers at 85 FR 40442 (July 6, 
2020). 

13 See 85 FR 40442 (July 6, 2020). The comment 

period for the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers was extended from Sept. 4, 2020 to Nov. 
3, 2020. See 85 FR 54946 (Sept. 3, 2020). 
14 See 86 FR 14696 (Mar. 18, 2021). 

With this Federal Register document, 
the Agencies are consolidating the July 
2020 Proposed Questions and Answers 
and the March 2021 Proposed Questions 
and Answers into one set of Interagency 
Questions and Answers Regarding 
Flood Insurance (2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers), consisting of 
144 Questions and Answers (including 
24 private flood insurance questions 
and answers), revised as appropriate 
based on comments received. 
Specifically, the Q&As in the March 
2021 Proposed Questions and Answers 
are now set forth as sections III, IV, and 
V in the 2020 Interagency Questions and 
Answers, and the remaining sections, 
with the exception of proposed Section 
III discussed below, are renumbered 
accordingly. The Agencies also are 
making non-substantive revisions to 
certain questions and answers to more 
directly respond to the question asked, 
provide additional clarity, or make 
technical corrections. 

These 2022 Interagency Questions 

and Answers supersede the 2009 
Interagency Questions and Answers 
(and the 2011 amendments to the 2009 
Interagency Questions and Answers) 
and supplement other guidance or 
interpretations issued by the Agencies 
related to loans in areas having special 
flood hazards. In addition to guidance 
and interpretations issued by the 
Agencies, lenders should be aware of 
information related to the NFIP 
provided by FEMA that may address 
questions pertaining to NFIP 
requirements. 

The issuance of these 2022 

Interagency Questions and Answers 
responds to requests over the years from 
the lending industry, including at 
conferences and through interagency 
webinars, to provide additional 
guidance on flood insurance compliance 
issues. In addition, the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers are responsive 
to requests made pursuant to the most 
recent review under the Economic 
Growth and Regulatory Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), 
which directs some of the Agencies to 
conduct a joint review of their 
regulations every 10 years and consider 
whether any of those regulations are 
outdated, unnecessary, or unduly 
burdensome.15 As part of the most 

15 Public Law 104–208, 110 Stat. 3001 (1996) 

(codified at 12 U.S.C. 3311). The most recent report 
to Congress required by EGRPRA was published by 
the Board, FDIC, OCC, and NCUA under the FFIEC 
in March 2017 and is available at https:// 
www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint- 
Report_to_Congress.pdf. The NCUA, although an 
FFIEC member, is not a ‘‘Federal banking agency’’ 
within the meaning of EGRPRA and so is not 
required to participate in the review process. 
Nevertheless, the NCUA elected to participate in 

recent joint review, the Board, FDIC, 
OCC, and NCUA received comments on 
the Agencies’ flood insurance rules. 
Several commenters asked for more 
guidance to the industry on flood 
insurance requirements, particularly 
with respect to renewal notices for 
force-placed insurance policies, the 
required amount of flood insurance, and 
flood insurance requirements for tenant- 
owned buildings and detached 
structures. One commenter specifically 
requested that the Agencies update the 
Interagency Questions and Answers. In 
the 2017 EGRPRA Joint Report to 
Congress issued by the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination 
Council (FFIEC), the Board, FDIC, and 
OCC indicated that they agreed with 
commenters that the Interagency 
Questions and Answers should be 
updated and planned to address many 
of the flood insurance issues raised by 
EGRPRA commenters.16 Accordingly, in 
issuing these 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers, the Agencies 
are addressing the commitment made in 
the 2017 EGRPRA Joint Report to 
Congress. 

Reorganization of Interagency 
Questions and Answers 

For ease of reference and in light of 

the increased number of subjects 
covered that address complex issues, 
the Agencies proposed to reorganize the 
Interagency Questions and Answers to 
provide a more logical flow of questions 
through the flood insurance process for 
lenders, servicers, regulators, and 
policyholders. Moreover, the Agencies 
also proposed a new system of 
designation for the Q&As. Rather than 
numbering the Q&As successively 

the EGRPRA review and conducted its own parallel 
review of its regulations. The FCA is not subject to 
EGRPRA; however, as required by the Farm Credit 
System Reform Act of 1996 (see 12 U.S.C. 2252 
note), FCA engages in periodic regulatory review. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), 
although an FFIEC member, is not a ‘‘Federal 
banking agency’’ within the meaning of EGRPRA 
and so is not required to participate in the review 
process. 

16 Specifically, the OCC, Board, and FDIC stated 
in the EGRPRA report that they ‘‘agree with these 
EGRPRA commenters that additional agency 
guidance on flood insurance requirements would be 
helpful to the banking industry and that the 
Interagency Flood Q&As should be updated to 
address recent amendments to the flood insurance 
statutes. In fact, the agencies have begun work on 
revising the Interagency Flood Q&As to reflect the 
agencies’ recently issued final rules implementing 
the Biggert-Waters Act and HFIAA requirements 
and to address other issues that have arisen since 
the last update in 2011. As part of this revision, the 
agencies also plan to address many of the flood 
insurance issues raised by EGRPRA commenters.’’

through all the categories, each Q&A 
would be designated by the category to 
which it belongs and then designated in 
numerical order for that particular 
category. This numbering system 
enables the Agencies to add or delete 
Q&As in the future without needing to 
significantly renumber or reorganize all 
of the Q&As. Furthermore, the Agencies 

have added three new Q&As 
(Applicability 13, Amount 10, and 
Condo and Co-op 9) to better address 
commenters’ questions and for 
organizational purposes, rather than 
adding information into existing Q&As. 
As discussed below, commenters 
supported the proposed reorganization. 
Therefore, the Agencies are adopting 

this reorganization with the inclusion of 
three new categories related to the 
private flood insurance requirements, 
proposed in the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. The table 
below sets forth the current categories 
and the corresponding new, reorganized 
categories for purposes of comparison:

For ease of reference, the following 

terms are used throughout this 
document: ‘‘Act’’ refers to the National 
Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the 
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as 
revised by the National Flood Insurance 
Reform Act of 1994, Biggert-Waters 
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, 
and Homeowner Flood Insurance 
Affordability Act of 2014 (codified at 42 
U.S.C. 4001 et seq). ‘‘Regulation’’ refers 

to each Agency’s current final rule.17 
References to the NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual refer to the version published in 
April 2021. 

Public Comments 

The Agencies solicited comment on 
all aspects of the proposed Q&As and 
received a total of 22 substantive 
comment letters on the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 

17 12 CFR part 22 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25 (Board); 
12 CFR part 339 (FDIC); 12 CFR part 614, subpart 
S (FCA); and 12 CFR part 760 (NCUA). 

11 substantive comment letters on the 
March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. Many of the commenters 
supported the proposed organizational 
changes to the Interagency Questions 
and Answers and believed the new 
organization provided clarity, increased 
understanding, and was user-friendly. 
In addition, some commenters 
specifically found the grouping by topic 
to be very useful, noting this would 
improve accessibility and allow the 
Agencies to easily revise the Interagency 
Questions and Answers in the future.

32829 

One commenter found the addition of 
references to the Regulation to be 
beneficial. Another commenter 
requested that the Agencies combine 
both sets of questions and answers into 
one set of final questions and answers. 
As indicated above, the Agencies are 
adopting the proposed reorganization of 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
and combining both the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one document. 

One commenter requested that these 
Interagency Questions and Answers be 
made available to insurance agents, 
which would be helpful for lenders and 
make the process easier for borrowers. A 
few commenters also suggested that the 
NCUA add the finalized Interagency 
Questions and Answers to the 
Regulation as an Appendix. The 
commenters felt that this would ensure 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
are easily located and used by credit 
union staff in years to come. 
The Agencies note that the 

Interagency Questions and Answers are 
already publicly available, including to 
insurance agents, as the Interagency 
Questions and Answers are published in 
the Federal Register and readily 
accessible on the Agencies’ websites. At 
this time, the Agencies decline to add 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
to the Regulation as an Appendix. 
Furthermore, the NCUA is committed to 
assisting credit unions comply with the 
flood insurance requirements. 

In addition, the Agencies received 

several comments that urged the 
Agencies to provide periodic updates 
and review the Interagency Questions 
and Answers on a regular basis, as well 
as to allow the industry an adequate 
notice and comment period. 
Commenters stated that this would 
provide industry and other stakeholders 
predictable opportunities to provide 
feedback on compliance issues and 
questions as they arise. Commenters 
also felt this type of review would 
maintain the Interagency Questions and 
Answers in a more organized manner 
and would ensure the guidance keeps 
pace with the marketplace and the 
issues that arise with respect to 
compliance. One commenter 
emphasized that this review should take 
place more frequently than the 10-year 
EGRPRA cycle and recommended a 
formal review of the Interagency 
Questions and Answers every three to 
five years. Other commenters stated that 
additional issues may arise for credit 
unions, who planned to share these 
issues with the NCUA, and asked that 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 

be updated in the future to provide 
additional clarity. 

The Agencies understand the value of 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
to the industry and other stakeholders 
and will continue to review the 
Interagency Questions and Answers and 
update the guidance as necessary. The 
Agencies agree that the reorganization of 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
will facilitate future updates. The 
Agencies expect to update the 
Interagency Questions and Answers as 
needed and will provide interested 
parties a sufficient notice and comment 
period. 

Other commenters encouraged the 
Agencies to include in the final version 
of the Interagency Questions and 
Answers an explicit statement 
referencing the Interagency Statement 
Clarifying the Role of Supervisory 
Guidance (Interagency Statement).18 
The commenters stated the Agencies 
should confirm that the Interagency 
Questions and Answers are guidance 
and failure to comply with the 
Interagency Questions and Answers are 
not grounds for matters requiring 
attention (MRAs), matters requiring 
immediate attention (MRIA), or any 
other adverse supervisory action. The 
Agencies confirm that the Agencies are 
providing the Interagency Questions 
and Answers as guidance only. The 
Agencies are not adding a reference to 
the Interagency Statement in the 
Interagency Questions and Answers 
because doing so is unnecessary. 

One commenter asked the Agencies to 

specifically reference which Q&As 
apply only to an NFIP policy and which 
Q&As apply to a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurance company 
or both. In response to this comment, 
the Agencies note that all the Q&As 
apply to all policies, whether NFIP or a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurance company, unless 
otherwise noted in the Q&A. 

The Agencies also received a general 
comment regarding climate change. The 
commenter noted that the Interagency 
Questions and Answers failed to discuss 
climate change risks. According to the 
commenter, climate change risks should 
serve as a ‘‘safe-harbor’’ for insurers to 
deny flood coverage. Further, the 
commenter suggested that the Agencies 
should explicitly require the insurers to 
consider climate risks and that flood 
insurance should be mandatory in high 
risk zones as a result of climate change. 

18 The OCC, Board, FDIC, and NCUA 

subsequently codified this statement. See 12 CFR 
part 4, appendix A to subpart F (OCC); 12 CFR part 
262, appendix A (Board); 12 CFR part 302, 
appendix A (FDIC); and 12 CFR part 791, appendix 
A to subpart D (NCUA). 

Climate change risk is outside the scope 
of the Agencies’ Interagency Questions 
and Answers. The Agencies note that 
they are working individually and on an 
interagency basis to address financial 
risks associated with climate change 
consistent with the Agencies’ regulatory 
and supervisory authorities. Therefore, 
the Agencies decline to make changes to 
any of the Q&As in response to this 
comment. 

Comments on specific Q&As are 
discussed below in the Section-by- 
Section Analysis. 

Section-by-Section Analysis 

Section I. Determining the Applicability 
of Flood Insurance Requirements for 
Certain Loans (Applicability) 

Section I includes questions and 
answers related to the applicability of 
the Regulation’s flood insurance 
requirements to certain loans. This 
proposed general applicability section 
included existing Q&As 1 through 7 
relating to residential buildings and, for 
organizational purposes, incorporated 
existing section V’s Q&As 24 and 25, 
which address flood insurance 
requirements for non-residential 
buildings. The Agencies also proposed a 
streamlined heading for this section to 
provide greater clarity with no intended 
change in substance or meaning. The 
Agencies proposed changes to the Q&As 
in this section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. 

Applicability 1. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 1 
as Q&A Applicability 1 with only minor 
language modifications, and no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A discusses whether 
the Regulation applies to a loan where 
the building or mobile home securing 
the loan is located in a community that 
does not participate in the NFIP. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting Q&A 
Applicability 1 as proposed with minor 
non-substantive edits. 

Applicability 2. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
24 as Q&A Applicability 2. This Q&A 
discusses whether a lender is required 
to mandate flood insurance for 
buildings with limited utility or value. 
The Agencies proposed to update this 
Q&A to indicate that the answer 
depends on whether buildings with 
limited utility meet the detached 
structure exemption, which provides an 
exemption from the mandatory 
purchase requirements for certain 
detached structures. This exemption 
was added by HFIAA. The proposal also 
removed the existing language 
indicating that the lender should

consider any local zoning issues or 
other issues that would affect its 
collateral. In addition, the Agencies 
made minor wording changes. 

The Agencies received one comment 
on this Q&A. The commenter suggested 
an alternative ‘‘carve-out’’ approach that 
would permit a lender to include all 
buildings in the security instrument as 
a matter of convenience in closing the 
loan and in marketing the parcel of land 
if necessary, even if a structure could 
have been ‘‘carved out’’ as not necessary 
for collateral. The commenter suggested 
that buildings that are included as 
security for a loan as a matter of 
convenience, and not to protect the 
lender by providing material credit 
support for the loan, would not be 
considered to be buildings ‘‘securing the 
loan’’ that need to be covered by flood 
insurance. However, the approach 
suggested by this commenter is not 
legally possible because the Act 19 
requires flood insurance on all 
improved property that secures a 
designated loan. The Agencies therefore 
are adopting Q&A Applicability 2 as 
proposed with an added cross-reference 
to Q&A Exemptions 1, which discusses 
the exemptions from the mandatory 
purchase requirement, for reader 
reference. 

Applicability 3. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
25 as proposed Q&A Applicability 3. 
This Q&A discusses a lender’s 
requirements under the Regulation for a 
loan secured by multiple buildings if 
only some of the buildings are located 
in an SFHA, or if some of the buildings 
are located in different communities 
and only some of the communities 
participate in the NFIP. The Agencies 
proposed to change the answer to 
emphasize when flood insurance is 
required as opposed to when it is not 
required as in the existing Q&A. 
Further, the Agencies proposed to 
include an example in the answer. The 
Agencies proposed these changes to 
provide greater clarity and to improve 
readability and did not intend any 
change in substance or meaning. 

The Agencies received two comments 
on this proposed Q&A. One commenter 
requested that the Agencies add a 
statement that the mandatory purchase 
requirement is only applicable to 
buildings with a physical footprint at 
least partially within the boundaries of 
an SFHA. This commenter stated that 
the extension of a plat or lot into the 
SFHA does not automatically trigger the 
mandatory purchase of flood insurance 
for buildings located on that plat or lot. 

19 Public Law 93–234, 87 Stat. 975 (1973), 

codified at 42 U.S.C. 4012a. 

The other commenter requested that the 
Agencies address situations when a 
portion of a property securing a loan is 
located in an SFHA but the 
improvements located on that same 
property are not located in the SFHA. 
The commenter recommends that if the 
structure is not located within an SFHA, 
then insurance should not be required. 
The Agencies confirm that land itself 

is not subject to the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement. To 
address these comments, the Agencies 
are clarifying in the final answer to this 
Q&A that if any portion of a building is 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act, the 
flood insurance requirement applies 
even if the entire structure is not located 
in the SFHA. Further, the Agencies are 
revising the final answer to state that a 
building located on a portion of a plat 
or lot that is not in an SFHA is not 
subject to the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement even if 
a portion of the plat or lot not 
containing a building extends into an 
SFHA. With these amendments and 
some minor non-substantive edits, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A 
Applicability 3. 

Applicability 4. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 2 
as Q&A Applicability 4. This Q&A 
discusses a lender’s responsibility if a 
particular building or mobile home that 
secures a loan is no longer located 
within an SFHA due to a map change. 
The Agencies proposed to broaden this 
Q&A to also address a lender’s 
responsibility if a building or mobile 
home that secures a loan is not located 
within an SFHA, even if not due to a 
map change. In addition, the Agencies 
proposed to reword for clarity the 
sentence in the answer indicating that a 
lender, by contract, may still require 
flood insurance on such buildings or 
mobile homes for safety and soundness 
purposes. The proposed sentence states 
that a lender may, at its discretion and 
taking into consideration appropriate 
State law, require flood insurance for 
property outside of SFHAs for safety 
and soundness purposes as a condition 
of a loan being made. Further, the 
Agencies proposed to add language to 
the answer to specifically note that each 
lender should tailor its own flood 
insurance policies and procedures to 
suit its business needs and protect its 
ongoing interest in the collateral. The 
Agencies intended no substantive 
changes with these revisions. The 
Agencies received no specific comment 
on this proposed Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed with one technical 
change. The Agencies are removing the 
discussion of the NFIP Preferred Risk 

Policy because of changes made by 
FEMA in Risk Rating 2.0—Equity in 
Action (Risk Rating 2.0).20 

Applicability 5. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 3 
as Q&A Applicability 5 and to revise it 
by making minor language 
modifications for greater clarity, with no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A discusses whether a 
lender’s purchase of a designated loan 
triggers any requirements under the 
Regulation. The Agencies received 
positive comment on this Q&A and are 
adopting it as proposed. 

Applicability 6. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 5, 
which addresses whether the Regulation 
applies to loans that are being 
restructured or modified, as proposed 
Q&A Applicability 6 with no changes. 
One commenter specifically stated that 
the clarification provided by Q&A 
Applicability 6 may be very helpful in 
light of the COVID–19 pandemic as 
more consumers may need to modify 
their mortgages. A few commenters 
requested that Q&A Applicability 6 
include additional examples to clarify 
when flood compliance requirements 
are triggered in loan restructurings and 
modifications, and they provided 
specific language. As in the existing 
Q&A, proposed Q&A Applicability 6 
states that if the loan otherwise meets 
the definition of a designated loan and 
if the lender increases the amount of the 
loan, or extends or renews the terms of 
the original loan, then the Regulation 
applies. However, the Agencies agree 
that additional clarification on when 
loan restructurings and modifications 
trigger the Regulation’s requirements 
would be helpful. Furthermore, the 
Agencies believe that rewording the 
question also would provide additional 
clarity. Therefore, the Agencies are 
revising the question in the final Q&A 
to ask whether a loan that is being 
restructured or modified constitutes a 
triggering event (making, increasing, 
renewing, or extending a loan) under 
the Regulation. In addition, the 
Agencies are revising the answer in the 
final Q&A to provide that if a loan 
modification or restructuring involves 
recapitalizing delinquent payments and 
other amounts due under the loan, or 
amounts that were otherwise originally 
contemplated to be part of the loan 
pursuant to the contract with the 
borrower, into the loan’s outstanding 
principal balance and the maturity date 
of the loan otherwise stays the same, the 
Regulation would not apply because the 
modification or restructuring would not

increase, extend, or renew the terms of 
the loan. The revisions to the final 
answer also provide that, conversely, if 
the loan modification or restructuring 
changes terms of the loan such as by 
increasing the outstanding principal 
balance beyond what was contemplated 
as part of the loan under the contract 
with the borrower, or by extending the 
maturity date of the loan, the Regulation 
would apply because the lender 
increased or extended the terms of the 
loan beyond what was originally 
contemplated to be part of the loan. 
With these amendments, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Applicability 6. 
Applicability 7. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 6, 
which addresses whether table funded 
loans are treated as new loan 
originations, as Q&A Applicability 7. 
The Agencies proposed to update the 
answer to refer to the definition of 
‘‘table funding’’ in the Regulation 
instead of to the obsolete definition of 
this term in the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development’s (HUD) former 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act 
(RESPA) rule. The Agencies received no 
specific comment on this Q&A and are 
adopting it as proposed. 

Applicability 8. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 7 
as Q&A Applicability 8 and proposed 
only one minor wording change, with 
no intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses whether 
a lender is required to perform a review 
of its, or of its servicers’, existing loan 
portfolio for compliance with the flood 
insurance requirements under the Act 
and Regulation. The Agencies received 
positive comment on this Q&A and are 
adopting it as proposed. 

Applicability 9. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 4 
as Q&A Applicability 9 and to make 
only minor language modifications for 
greater clarity, with no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This proposed 
Q&A addressed whether the mandatory 
purchase requirements apply to loan 
syndications or participations. The 
proposed answer provided that the 
acquisition by a lender of an interest in 
a loan either by participation or 
syndication after that loan has been 
made does not trigger the requirements 
of the Act or the Regulation but that, as 
with purchased loans, depending upon 
the circumstances, the lender may 
undertake due diligence for safety and 
soundness purposes to protect itself 
against the risk of flood or other types 
of loss. The proposed answer also stated 
that lenders who pool or contribute 
funds that will be simultaneously 
advanced to a borrower or borrowers as 
a loan secured by improved real estate 

would be making a loan that triggers the 
requirements of the Act and Regulation, 
and that Federal flood insurance 
requirements also would apply when a 
group of lenders refinances, extends, 
renews or increases a loan. Further, the 
proposed answer provided that although 
the agreement among the lenders may 
assign compliance duties to a lead 
lender or agent, and may include 
clauses in which the lead lender or 
agent indemnifies participating lenders 
against flood losses, each participating 
lender remains individually responsible 
for compliance with the Act and 
Regulation. Therefore, under the 
proposed answer, the Agencies would 
examine whether the regulated 
institution/participating lender has 
performed upfront due diligence to 
determine whether the lead lender or 
agent has undertaken the necessary 
activities to ensure that the borrower 
obtains appropriate flood insurance and 
that the lead lender or agent has 
adequate controls to monitor the loan(s) 
on an ongoing basis for compliance with 
the flood insurance requirements. 
Lastly, the proposed answer stated that 
the Agencies expect the participating 
lender to have adequate controls to 
monitor the activities of the lead lender 
or agent for compliance with flood 
insurance requirements over the term of 
the loan. 

The Agencies received a number of 

comments on this Q&A. Some 
commenters requested that the Agencies 
offer further clarity on what constitutes 
sufficient ‘‘upfront due diligence’’ and 
‘‘adequate controls to monitor the 
activities of the lead lender or agent for 
compliance with flood insurance 
requirements over the term of the loan.’’ 
These commenters also stated that 
problems arise when lead lenders have 
different regulators employing different 
approaches for upfront due diligence as 
well as monitoring for flood 
compliance. One commenter 
recommended the inclusion of an 
explicit statement in the Q&A that if a 
lead lender on a facility is not federally 
regulated, and thus not subject to flood 
compliance requirements, any 
participating lenders on that facility also 
do not have flood compliance 
obligations with respect to that facility. 
Another commenter requested that the 
Agencies indicate in the Q&A that as 
long as a participating non-lead lender 
has adopted written policies, 
procedures, and processes for managing 
the risks of flood compliance that are 
reasonably within that participating 
lender’s control, that lender generally 
would be viewed as having satisfied its 
flood compliance obligations. A third 

commenter stated that the answer was 
confusing since it appears to state that 
flood compliance requirements can be 
assigned to the lead lender but 
subsequently states that each individual 
lender remains responsible for 
compliance. The commenter suggested 
that, in instances where a lead lender is 
in charge of ensuring flood insurance 
requirements are met, participating 
lenders be allowed to rely on, as a safe 
harbor, documentation from the lead 
lender to limit their individual 
exposure. 

The Agencies understand the 
compliance complications that may 
arise with loan syndications and 
participations. However, the 
requirements under the Act and the 
Regulation apply to each lender 
individually, even if they are part of a 
loan syndication or participation. The 
Agencies may not remove these 
requirements as suggested if the lead 
lender is not federally-regulated nor 
create a safe harbor that allows a lender 
to rely on the lead lender’s policies or 
procedures or on others’ policies and 
procedures for compliance. Further, the 
Agencies believe it is more appropriate 
for lenders to determine specific due 
diligence procedures and controls to 
ensure compliance with the Act and 
Regulation based on the particular facts 
of each transaction. Therefore, the 
Agencies decline to include examples of 
such procedures and controls in the 
Q&A. However, to emphasize the 
particular concerns that may arise with 
lead lenders who are not federally- 
regulated, the Agencies are adding a 
statement in the final answer indicating 
that a non-lead lender’s due diligence 
and monitoring of the lead lender is 
especially important when the lead 
lender itself is not subject to Federal 
flood insurance requirements. With this 
amendment, the Agencies are adopting 
Q&A Applicability 9. 

Applicability 10. The Agencies 

proposed new Q&A Applicability 10 to 
address a lender’s obligations when 
participating in a multi-tranche credit 
facility, specifically whether a lender is 
expected to consider any triggering 
event and any cashless roll of which it 
becomes aware in any tranche. The 
proposed answer provided that a multi- 
tranche credit facility is analogous to a 
loan syndication or participation and 
that the Agencies do not expect a lender 
participating in one tranche in a multi- 
tranche credit facility to be responsible 
for taking action to comply with flood 
insurance requirements in connection 
with a triggering event or cashless roll 
that occurs in a tranche in which the 
lender does not participate. 
Furthermore, the proposed answer

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

clarified that the Agencies expect a 
lender participating in a multi-tranche 
credit facility to perform upfront due 
diligence to determine whether the lead 
lender has adequate controls to monitor 
the loan on an ongoing basis for 
compliance with flood insurance 
requirements. One commenter requested 
the same changes it suggested for 
proposed Q&A Applicability 9 regarding 
further clarification on what constitutes 
sufficient upfront due diligence and 
adequate controls and removal of flood 
compliance requirements if the lead 
lender is not federally-regulated. For the 
reasons stated in the discussion of Q&A 
Applicability 9, the Agencies decline to 
accept these changes and are adopting 
Q&A Applicability 10 as proposed with 
the addition of a similar statement 
added to Q&A Applicability 9 regarding 
due diligence and non-Federal lead 
lenders. 

Applicability 11. The Agencies 

proposed new Q&A Applicability 11 to 
clarify that an automatic extension of a 
credit facility agreed upon by the 
borrower and lender in the original loan 
agreement would not constitute a 
triggering event for purposes of the 
Federal flood insurance requirements. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comment on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed. 

Applicability 12. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Applicability 12, 
based on guidance previously issued by 
the Agencies,21 to address the 
applicability of the mandatory purchase 
requirement during a period of time 
when coverage under the NFIP is 
unavailable, such as due to a lapse in 
authorization or in appropriations. The 
proposed answer clarified that during a 
period when NFIP coverage is not 
available, lenders may continue to make 
loans subject to the Regulation without 
flood insurance coverage but must 
continue to make flood determinations, 
provide timely, complete and accurate 
notices to borrowers, and comply with 
other aspects of the Regulation. The 
proposed answer also indicated that 
lenders should evaluate the safety and 
soundness and legal risks, and 
prudently manage those risks, during 
such periods when the NFIP is 
unavailable. One commenter 

21 See Guidance Regarding Lapse and Extension 

of FEMA’s Authority to Issue Flood Insurance 
Contracts, OCC Bulletin 2010–20 (OCC); Informal 
Guidance on the Lapse of FEMA’s Authority to 
Issue Flood Insurance Contracts, CA Letter 10–3 
(Board); Lapse of FEMA Authority to Issue Flood 
Insurance Policies, FIL–23–2010 (FDIC); Lapse and 
Extension of FEMA’s Authority to Issue Flood 
Insurance Contracts, Informational Memorandum 
June 3, 2010 (FCA), and Guidance on the Lapse of 
FEMA’s Authority to Issue Flood Insurance 
Contracts, Letter No. 10–CU–08 (NCUA). 

specifically commented on this 
proposed Q&A, stating that it provides 
helpful and appreciated clarity on how 
credit unions should proceed in the 
event of a lapse in authorization or 
appropriations. The Agencies are 
adopting this Q&A as proposed. 
New Q&A Applicability 13. To 

address a number of comments 
regarding what is and is not a triggering 
event under the Regulation, and to 
further clarify the Interagency Questions 
and Answers Regarding Flood 
Insurance, the Agencies are adding a 
new Q&A Applicability 13 to the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers to 
specifically address triggering events. 
This new Q&A provides lenders with a 
quick reference of what constitutes a 
triggering event under the Regulation. 
Specifically, Q&A Applicability 13 

states that under the Regulation, a 
triggering event occurs when a 
designated loan is made, increased, 
extended, or renewed. If a triggering 
event occurs with respect to a 
designated loan, the lender is required 
to comply with certain requirements of 
the Regulation, including the mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirement, 
the requirement to provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower, 
the requirement to notify the 
Administrator of FEMA or the 
Administrator’s designee (the insurance 
provider) in writing of the identity of 
the servicer of the loan, and the 
requirement to escrow for a loan 
secured by residential property, unless 
either the lender or the loan qualifies for 
an exception. This Q&A also includes 
examples of events that are not 
considered triggering events for 
purposes of the Regulation, including 
the purchase of a loan from another 
lender (see Q&A Applicability 5); a loan 
modification that does not increase the 
amount of the loan nor extend or renew 
the terms of the loan (see Q&A 
Applicability 6); the assumption of the 
loan by another borrower; the 
remapping of a building securing the 
loan into an SFHA; the acquisition by a 
lender of an interest in a loan either by 
participation or syndication (see Q&A 
Applicability 9); a cashless roll (see 
Q&A Applicability 10); certain 
automatic extensions of credit (see Q&A 
Applicability 11); and certain treatments 
of force placement premiums and fees 
(see Q&A Force Placement 10). 

Applicability 14 (Proposed as Q&A 
Coverage 2). The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing Q&A 64 as Q&A 
Coverage 2. As noted below, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Q&A as 
Q&A Applicability 14. This Q&A 
addresses when a lender may rely on an 
insurance policy providing portfolio- 

wide coverage, removes the reference to 
criteria set forth by FEMA, and includes 
language addressing a lender’s reliance 
on a policy that provides portfolio-wide 
coverage. 

Several commenters suggested that 
the Agencies clarify the term ‘‘portfolio- 
wide’’ coverage to explain that the 
typical ‘‘master policy’’ that lenders 
obtain and use to force place flood 
insurance on individual loans is 
different than portfolio-wide coverage. 
The Agencies agree with the 
commenters and are clarifying that a 
lender may not rely on an insurance 
policy providing portfolio-wide 
coverage to meet the flood insurance 
purchase or force placement 
requirements if the policy only provides 
coverage to the lender (‘‘single 
interest’’). As stated in the Regulation, 
flood insurance coverage under the 
discretionary acceptance provision must 
cover both the mortgagor and mortgagee 
(i.e., lender and the borrower) as loss 
payees, except in the case of a policy 
that is provided by a condominium 
association, cooperative, homeowners 
association, or other applicable group 
and for which the premium is paid by 
the respective organization. However, 
the Agencies are adding language to the 
answer indicating that lenders may 
purchase a master flood insurance 
policy that provides coverage for its 
entire portfolio and covers both the 
lender and the borrower (‘‘dual 
interest’’) because these policies provide 
coverage for the entire portfolio as well 
as individual coverage, and include the 
issuance of an individual policy or 
certificate. 

A few commenters suggested that the 

answer be clarified to state that a 
portfolio-wide gap policy may be useful 
in some circumstances, such as when a 
property is newly mapped into an 
SFHA. Additionally, a few commenters 
suggested that lenders be allowed to rely 
on master policies for compliance 
purposes. The Agencies decline to make 
these revisions. As noted in the existing 
and proposed Q&A, master policies 
providing portfolio-wide coverage may 
be useful protection for the lender for a 
gap in coverage in the period of time 
before a force-placed policy takes effect; 
however, such policies do not provide 
coverage for the borrower and cannot be 
used to satisfy the force placement 
requirement. 

One commenter stated that using the 
term ‘‘private insurance policy’’ may be 
confused with a borrower-procured 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer. The Agencies agree and 
are making technical changes to remove 
the term ‘‘private’’ when referring to

lender procured flood insurance 
policies in the Q&A. 

The Agencies are adopting this Q&A 

as proposed with the amendments 
discussed above and an additional 
minor non-substantive change. 

Applicability 15 (Proposed as Q&A 
Coverage 3). The Agencies proposed 
new Q&A Coverage 3 to address when 
mandatory flood insurance on a 
designated loan is required to be in 
place during the closing process. As 
noted below, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Q&A as Q&A 
Applicability 15. This proposed Q&A 
clarified that a lender should use the 
loan ‘‘closing date’’ to determine the 
date by which flood insurance should 
be in place for a designated loan, and 
that FEMA deems the ‘‘closing date’’ as 
the date the ownership of the property 
transfers to the new owner based on 
State law. The proposed answer further 
explained the difference between ‘‘wet 
funding’’ and ‘‘dry funding’’ States and 
how it impacts the ‘‘closing date’’ for 
purposes of flood insurance. 

A few commenters suggested 
expanding the Q&A to clarify the 
‘‘closing date’’ for refinances subject to 
rescission. One lender suggested that it 
would be helpful to add examples to 
illustrate when mandatory flood 
insurance needs to be in place on a 
designated loan. The Agencies agree and 
are expanding the answer to address 
transactions where there is no transfer 
of property ownership, such as a 
refinance, and the borrower is 
purchasing a new flood insurance 
policy or is required to increase flood 
insurance coverage. In these cases, the 
lender should use the loan’s 
consummation date, which is the date 
the borrower becomes contractually 
obligated on the loan, as the effective 
date for the flood insurance policy. As 
a result of this clarification, the 
Agencies do not believe adding 
examples is necessary. The Agencies are 
adopting this Q&A with the changes 
discussed above. 

Section II. Exemptions From the 
Mandatory Flood Insurance Purchase 
Requirements (Exemptions) 

Existing section III includes one Q&A 

related to the exemptions from the 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirements. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing section III as 
section II and proposed a streamlined 
heading for this section to provide 
greater clarity with no intended change 
in substance or meaning. As proposed, 
section II includes existing Q&A 18 and 
six new Q&As, Exemptions 2 through 7, 
pertaining to the exemption from the 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 

requirements for certain detached 
structures created by HFIAA. The 
Agencies proposed changes to the Q&As 
in this section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. As noted in the 
proposal, this set of Q&As on the 
detached structure exemption responds 
to a request for more guidance related to 
this exemption, as documented in the 
EGRPRA report.22 

Exemptions 1. The Agencies proposed 

to redesignate existing Q&A 18 as Q&A 
Exemptions 1. This Q&A discusses the 
exemptions from the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement. The 
Agencies proposed to revise the Q&A to 
include the detached structure 
exemption in addition to the existing 
exemptions for State-owned property 
and loans with an original principal 
balance of $5,000 or less and an original 
repayment term of one year or less. The 
proposed Q&A also noted that although 
an exemption may apply, a borrower 
may still elect to purchase flood 
insurance or a lender may still require 
flood insurance as a condition of 
making the loan for purposes of safety 
and soundness, depending on its risk 
analysis. One commenter requested 
further clarity and examples on what 
constitutes a detached structure. 
Another commenter requested 
clarification on ‘‘mixed use’’ property 
where detached buildings that may have 
been used for commercial purposes but 
no longer have a commercial use could 
fall under the residential exemption if 
the residence is using the structure for 
storage. The Agencies note that what 
constitutes a detached structure is a 
fact-based determination and that the 
lender, who is in the best position to 
consider all the facts and circumstances 
and with input from the borrower, has 
the responsibility to determine what 
constitutes a detached structure and its 
purpose or the primary use of a mixed 
use structure. The Agencies are not in 
a position to provide examples for all 
possible scenarios. The Agencies also 
are including a cross reference to Q&A 
Exemptions 2 to provide further 
guidance and therefore are adopting the 
Q&A with this addition. 

Exemptions 2. The Agencies proposed 

new Q&A Exemptions 2 to address 
whether a lender must take a security 
interest in the primary residential 
structure for a detached structure to be 
eligible for the detached structure 
exemption. The proposed answer 
provided that although a lender does 
not have to take a security interest in the 
primary residential structure, it would 
need to evaluate the uses of the 

22 https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_

EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf. 

detached structures to confirm each is 
eligible for the exemption. One 
commenter suggested that the Agencies 
provide more examples of a primary 
residential structure. The Agencies 
decline to provide examples as the 
Agencies have indicated in the 
preamble to the 2015 Final Rule that 
whether a structure is defined as a 
primary residential structure is fact 
specific and that lenders would need to 
conduct good faith due diligence to 
make this determination. Another 
commenter suggested the Agencies 
separate this Q&A into two discrete 
questions to highlight different aspects 
of the answer. The Agencies decline to 
adopt this suggestion because the 
example is intertwined with the 
principles being discussed in the 
answer. Accordingly, the Agencies are 
adopting the Q&A as proposed. 

Exemptions 3. The Agencies proposed 

new Q&A Exemptions 3 to clarify that 
a flood hazard determination is required 
for a detached structure even though 
flood insurance coverage is not required 
on such a structure because the 
determination is used to identify the 
number and type of structures present 
on the property. One commenter noted 
that in practice, lenders first obtain a 
flood hazard determination as to the 
entire parcel of property to determine if 
any structures are located in an SFHA 
and then determine whether any 
detached structures on the property may 
be exempt under the Regulation, and 
therefore the proposed Q&A may imply 
that the presence or absence of exempt 
structures may affect whether a flood 
hazard determination is required. The 
Agencies agree that this Q&A may be 
confusing as proposed. As a result, the 
Agencies are revising the Q&A to clarify 
that a flood hazard determination is 
required even where detached 
structures are present. The revised 
answer provides that a flood hazard 
determination is needed to determine 
whether a building or mobile home 
securing a loan is or will be located in 
an SFHA where flood insurance is 
available under the Act. The answer 
further provides that in order to 
determine whether the exemption for 
non-residential detached structures on 
residential property may apply, a flood 
hazard determination must be 
conducted first, without regard to 
whether there may be any detached 
structures that could be exempt. With 
these amendments, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Exemptions 3. 

Exemptions 4. The Agencies proposed 

new Q&A Exemptions 4 to provide that 
a lender or its servicer may cancel its 
flood insurance requirement on an 
eligible detached structure that is

currently insured, but that a lender 
alternatively may want to continue to 
require flood insurance coverage for 
detached structures of relatively high 
value if such coverage would be 
beneficial to the borrower and the 
lender. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this Q&A and are 
adopting the Q&A as proposed. 

Exemptions 5. The Agencies proposed 

new Q&A Exemptions 5 to address 
whether a property being remapped into 
an SFHA triggers a review of the 
intended use of each detached structure. 
Specifically, the proposed answer stated 
that a lender must examine the status of 
a detached structure upon a qualifying 
triggering event and that a remapping is 
not a triggering event. The proposed 
answer also stated that although there is 
no duty to monitor the status of a 
detached structure following the 
lender’s initial determination, sound 
risk management practices may lead a 
lender to conduct scheduled periodic 
reviews that track the need for flood 
insurance on properties securing loans 
in its portfolio. Further, the proposed 
answer notes that, consistent with 
existing obligations under the 
Regulation, if a lender determines at any 
time that a property, including a 
detached structure, has become subject 
to the mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement and, as a result, 
the collateral is uninsured or 
underinsured, the lender has a duty to 
inform the borrower of the obligation to 
obtain or increase insurance coverage 
and to purchase flood insurance on the 
borrower’s behalf, as necessary. 

One commenter asked whether 

notification of a map change constitutes 
notice that the property may be subject 
to the mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement. Another 
commenter inquired whether this Q&A 
allows a lender to rely on the initial 
appraisal as to what the detached 
structure is being used for or whether 
the lender is responsible for 
determining the current use. One 
commenter noted that the answer 
reiterates the requirements for force 
placement which do not seem relevant 
to the answer. Based on the comments 
received, the Agencies are revising the 
question to focus instead on whether a 
triggering event requires a lender to 
review the intended use of the detached 
structure. The answer remains 
unchanged, except for removing the 
language regarding remapping and force 
placement and non-substantive wording 
changes for clarification. In addition, 
the Agencies are including a reference 
to new Q&A Applicability 13, which 
explains what constitutes a triggering 

event. With these changes, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Exemptions 5. 

Exemptions 6. The Agencies proposed 

three Q&As under Section III Coverage 
to other sections as noted below and 
reassigning section III. 

new Q&A Exemptions 6 to discuss 
whether a lender, following a review of 
its loan portfolio, may determine to no 
longer require flood insurance on a 
detached structure in an SFHA if the 
structure does not provide contributory 
value. The Agencies proposed to clarify 
that, while a lender or servicer could 
initiate such a review, the Regulation 
does not permit the exemption of 
structures from the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement based 
solely on their contributory value. 
Instead, a specific exemption must 
apply. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this Q&A and are 
adopting the Q&A as proposed. 

Exemptions 7. The Agencies proposed 

new Q&A Exemptions 7 to address 
whether a building would qualify as a 
detached structure if it is joined to 
another building by a stairway or 
covered walkway. The proposed answer 
provided that for purposes of the 
detached structure exemption, a 
structure is ‘‘detached’’ from the 
primary residential structure if it is not 
joined by any structural connection to 
that structure, and ‘‘stands alone.’’ One 
commenter suggested that the Agencies 
allow lenders to defer to an insurer’s 
definition for a structural connection as 
this term is not defined in the 
Regulation or statute, or that the 
Agencies define this term. As indicated 
in the proposed Q&A, the Agencies have 
interpreted this term to mean a structure 
is ‘‘detached’’ if it stands alone and that 
this interpretation is consistent with the 
coverage provision of the NFIP’s 
Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) 
for additions and extensions to a 
dwelling unit. The proposed answer 
also included a reference to the NFIP 
Flood Insurance Manual for additional 
information. However, the Agencies are 
amending the Q&A to track the language 
of the Regulation and are removing the 
FEMA example as it is unnecessary. 
Therefore, the Agencies are adopting the 
Q&A with these changes. 

Proposed Section III. Coverage (NFIP/ 
Private Flood Insurance) 

The Agencies proposed in the July 
2020 Questions and Answers to move 
existing section XI to section III. This 
section included two new Q&As 
(Coverage 1 and 3), and existing Q&A 64 
redesignated as Coverage 2. Because the 
Agencies are consolidating the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers, for organizational purposes, in 
the 2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers the Agencies are moving the 

The Agencies proposed new Q&A 
Coverage 1 in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers to assist lenders 
in complying with the discretionary 
acceptance provision and mutual aid 
societies provision in the Agencies’ 
2019 Final Rule. The Agencies are 
redesignating this Q&A as Q&A 
Discretionary 4. Please refer to Section 
IV, Q&A Discretionary 4 for the 
Agencies response to comments. 

The Agencies proposed to redesignate 

existing Q&A 64 as Coverage 2. This 
Q&A addresses when a lender may rely 
on an insurance policy providing 
portfolio-wide coverage, removes the 
reference to criteria set forth by FEMA, 
and includes language addressing a 
lender’s reliance on a policy that 
provides portfolio-wide coverage. The 
Agencies are re-designating this Q&A as 
Q&A Applicability 14. Please refer to 
Section I, Q&A Applicability 14 for the 
Agencies response to comments. 

The Agencies proposed new Q&A 
Coverage 3 in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers to address when 
mandatory flood insurance on a 
designated loan is required to be in 
place during the closing process. The 
Agencies redesignated Q&A Coverage 3 
as Q&A Applicability 15. Please refer to 
Section I, Q&A Applicability 15 for the 
Agencies response to comments. 

Additionally, the Agencies proposed 

in the July 2020 Proposed Questions 
and Answers to delete existing Q&A 63 
because it was inconsistent with the 
Agencies’ final rule implementing the 
private flood insurance provision of the 
Biggert-Waters Act.23 The Agencies 
received no specific comment on this 
proposed change and are deleting this 
Q&A as proposed. 

Section III. Private Flood Insurance— 
Mandatory Acceptance (Mandatory) 

The 2019 Final Rule requires lenders 
to accept ‘‘private flood insurance,’’ as 
defined in the Biggert-Waters Act 
(mandatory acceptance). In order to 
assist lenders in evaluating whether a 
flood insurance policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance,’’ 
the 2019 Final Rule also includes a 
compliance aid provision. Under the 
compliance aid provision, a lender may 
conclude that a policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
without further review if the policy, or 
an endorsement to the policy, contains 
the compliance aid statement set forth 
in the rule.

32835 

The Agencies proposed a number of 
Q&As regarding mandatory acceptance 
and the compliance aid provision in the 
March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. As discussed in further detail 
below, the Agencies are combining 
proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 with 
proposed Q&A Discretionary 4 and 
renumbering the Q&A as Q&A Private 
Flood Compliance 11. The Agencies 
also are renumbering the other Q&As in 
this section accordingly. 

General Comments. The Agencies 

received some general comments 
regarding the Q&As related to the 
mandatory acceptance of private flood 
insurance policies. One commenter was 
supportive of the proposed Q&As, 
stating that the Agencies’ 
implementation of the mandatory 
acceptance provisions and widespread 
use of a compliance aid assurance 
clause have allowed the private flood 
insurance market to thrive. This 
commenter believed the mandatory 
acceptance provisions facilitate private 
policy placements, ensure that 
consumers have access to affordable 
flood coverage, and provide security to 
lenders seeking to fulfill their 
compliance obligation. 

Another commenter suggested the 
Q&As could incorporate language that 
clarifies digital transmission of relevant 
flood coverage documents, as well as 
physical transmission or use of paper 
documents, is permissible. As explained 
under Q&A Discretionary 2, the 
Regulation does not address the 
acceptability of electronic records, but 
lenders may accept electronic and 
digital records for recordkeeping 
purposes. 

One commenter noted that a number 
of the mandatory acceptance Q&As refer 
to ‘‘reviews’’ of private flood insurance 
policies. This commenter stated that it 
would be helpful to clarify that a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer is subject to two different 
reviews. According to the commenter, 
as with any flood insurance policy, 
including NFIP policies, the lender or 
servicer must conduct the mandatory 
purchase requirement review in 
connection with a triggering event. The 
commenter stated that this review 
would include, among other things, 
determining whether the policy 
contains the appropriate coverage 
limits, deductible, term of coverage, and 
mortgagee clause. In addition, the 
commenter stated that, the lender or 
servicer must determine whether a 
private flood insurance policy satisfies 
the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ or could otherwise be 
accepted by a lender under the 
discretionary acceptance criteria. The 

commenter requested this clarification 
throughout the Interagency Questions 
and Answers. 

The Agencies understand the 

commenter’s confusion regarding the 
term ‘‘review’’ as used in some of the 
Q&As in the mandatory acceptance 
section. The Agencies have generally 
clarified the type of review involved for 
relevant mandatory acceptance Q&As, 
either in the text of the Q&A or the 
preamble. 

Mandatory 1. Proposed new Q&A 

Mandatory 1 addressed whether a 
lender may decide to only accept 
private flood insurance policies under 
the mandatory acceptance provision of 
the Regulation. The proposed answer 
confirmed that a lender may decide to 
only accept private flood insurance 
policies that the lender is required to 
accept under the mandatory acceptance 
provision because the policies meet the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
under the Regulation. The proposed 
answer also clarified that a lender is not 
required to accept flood insurance 
policies that only meet the criteria set 
forth in the discretionary acceptance or 
mutual aid provision in the Regulation. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comments on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed with minor non- 
substantive edits. 

Mandatory 2 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 3). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 3 addressed whether the 
private flood insurance requirements 
under the Regulation require a lender to 
change its policy of not originating a 
mortgage in non-participating 
communities or coastal barrier regions 
where the NFIP is not available. The 
proposed answer explained that the 
Regulation does not require a lender to 
originate a loan that does not meet the 
lender’s underwriting criteria. Further, 
the proposed answer noted that the 
flood insurance purchase requirement 
only applies to loans secured by 
structures located or to be located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act. As stated in 
Q&A Applicability 1, as proposed and 
as adopted by the Agencies, the 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirement does not apply within non- 
participating communities where NFIP 
insurance is not available under the Act. 
Therefore, the proposed answer states 
that the lender does not need to change 
its policy of not originating mortgages in 
areas where NFIP insurance is 
unavailable solely because of the private 
flood insurance requirements under the 
Regulation. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this Q&A and are 
adopting it as proposed, with minor 

changes for clarity, and renumbered as 
Q&A Mandatory 2. 

Mandatory 3 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 4). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 4 addressed whether the 
compliance aid assurance clause could 
act as a conformity clause that would 
make a flood insurance policy issued by 
a private insurer conform to the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
under the Regulation. The proposed 
answer clarified that the compliance aid 
assurance clause is not intended to act 
as a conformity clause but rather to 
facilitate the ability of lenders and 
borrowers to recognize policies that 
meet the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ and promote the consistent 
acceptance of policies that meet this 
definition. 

The Agencies received a few 

comments on this proposed Q&A. One 
commenter agreed in principle that the 
compliance aid language should not, 
and cannot, act as a conformity clause, 
due mainly to the unique legal status 
that the term ‘‘conformity clause’’ has in 
State insurance regulation and contract 
law. Another commenter noted that 
whether the compliance aid assurance 
clause acts as a conformity clause is best 
interpreted by State insurance 
regulation and contract law. The third 
commenter explained that interpretation 
of insurance contracts, including 
whether the compliance aid assurance 
clause acts as a conformity clause, 
should be a matter of State law. This 
commenter further stated that this Q&A 
is outside the scope of the Federal flood 
insurance statutes and regulations, and 
is outside the Agencies’ authority to 
interpret and apply those Federal 
statutes and regulations. The commenter 
recommended instead that the Agencies 
address this question by providing 
guidance that this is a matter of State 
insurance contract law. The Agencies 
disagree with this commenter’s 
statement regarding the scope of the Act 
and Regulation and the Agencies’ 
authority to interpret or apply the Act 
and Regulation. The Agencies adopted 
the compliance aid provision in the 
Regulation pursuant to the authority 
granted to the Agencies in the Act to 
issue the Regulation.24 Therefore, the 
Agencies have the authority to interpret 
this provision in a Q&A. 

Additionally, a few of the commenters 

recommended that the Agencies delete 
references to ‘‘assurance clause’’ in this 
Q&A and revert to prior language that 
simply refers to this clause as the 
compliance aid language or statement. 
The commenters noted that the addition 
of ‘‘assurance clause’’ in the current 

24 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)(1).

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Q&A could infer a meaning beyond that 
intended by the Agencies because the 
term ‘‘assurance clause’’ has broad 
meaning under State insurance 
regulations and insurance laws. The 
Agencies agree with these comments. 
The Agencies are removing references to 
‘‘assurance clause’’ in the final Q&A, as 
well as in the other Q&As, and will refer 
to this as the ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ per the Regulation. With this 
change, and a minor change for clarity, 
the Agencies are adopting this Q&A as 
proposed and renumbered as Q&A 
Mandatory 3. 

Mandatory 4 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 5). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 5 stated that a lender is not 
required to accept a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer solely 
because the policy contains the 
compliance aid assurance clause if the 
lender chooses to conduct its own 
review and determines the flood 
insurance policy actually does not meet 
the mandatory acceptance requirements. 
The proposed answer noted that if a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer does not include the 
compliance aid assurance clause, the 
lender must still review the policy to 
determine if it meets the requirements 
for private flood insurance as set forth 
in the Regulation before the lender may 
choose to reject the policy. 

One commenter believed that a flood 

insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer that includes the compliance aid 
statement must be accepted and did not 
support Q&A Mandatory 5. The 
Agencies have been clear that a lender 
is not required to accept a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer solely because it contains the 
compliance aid statement. Lenders may 
still, at their discretion, review a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer that contains the compliance aid 
statement and reject the policy if they 
do not believe it meets the definition of 
‘‘private flood insurance’’ or if it does 
not meet other requirements of the 
Regulation, such as providing the 
required amount of insurance. 

Other commenters emphasized that 

Q&A Mandatory 5 is confusing and 
unclear. For example, commenters 
pointed out that a lender does not have 
to accept a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer that does not 
meet the coverage requirements and a 
review is not required if a policy does 
not meet the coverage requirements. 
Commenters were unsure if the 
‘‘required to accept’’ phrase in the 
question applies only to an assessment 
of whether the policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
or if a lender could be required to accept 

the policy even if the policy is 
otherwise insufficient (such as the 
required dollar amount of coverage). 
Some commenters believed the 

Agencies make an assumption about a 
given lender’s processes by concluding 
that the lender would review a policy 
under mandatory acceptance criteria 
before the lender would review under 
discretionary acceptance criteria even 
though the Agencies make clear under 
proposed Q&A Mandatory 8 that a 
lender ‘‘may first review the policy to 
determine whether it meets the criteria 
under the discretionary acceptance 
provision.’’ One commenter emphasized 
that the Agencies go further than 
necessary in the proposed response and 
seem to dictate certain processes for the 
lender. 

In addition, commenters suggested 

the Agencies consider alternative 
language for Q&A Mandatory 5. One 
commenter was confused by the 
Agencies’ choice of language that did 
not align with the Regulation or the 
preamble discussion on the proposed 
Q&A. One commenter recommended the 
Agencies modify the answer to use plain 
language from the 2019 Final Rule and 
use consistent language to avoid 
confusion regarding key compliance 
concepts. 

As explained in the preamble to the 
2019 Final Rule, the Regulation does not 
permit lenders to reject a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer solely because the policy is not 
accompanied by the compliance aid 
statement.25 The Agencies stress that the 
compliance aid statement is meant to be 
an aid for lenders and it is not required 
for lenders to accept a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer. In 
addition, lenders should remember that 
other aspects of the Regulation must be 
met for a lender to accept a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer, even if the policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance.’’ 
However, the Agencies understand 
the commenters’ concerns about Q&A 
Mandatory 5 as proposed and are 
incorporating suggested changes to 
address these issues. The final answer 
provides that if a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer includes the 
compliance aid statement, the lender 
may choose to rely upon the statement 
and would not need to review the policy 
further to determine if the policy meets 
the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance.’’ The final answer also makes 
clear, however, that the lender is not 
required to accept this policy based 
upon inclusion of the compliance aid 
statement alone and may choose to 

25 84 FR 4953, 4959 (Feb. 20, 2019). 

make its own determination about 
whether the policy meets the definition 
of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ or whether 
the policy is acceptable under the 
discretionary acceptance or mutual aid 
criteria. In addition, if a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer does 
not include the compliance aid 
statement, the final answer provides 
that the lender may not reject the policy 
solely because it does not include this 
statement. The final answer also states 
that a lender is not relieved from the 
requirement to accept a policy that 
meets the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ and provides the required 
amount of insurance under the 
Regulation. The final answer also 
provides that the lender may determine 
the policy is acceptable under the 
discretionary acceptance or mutual aid 
criteria. 

Lastly, as mentioned in Q&A 
Mandatory 3 in this section, the 
Agencies are changing the term 
‘‘compliance aid assurance clause’’ 
throughout this Q&A to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. 

With these changes, the Agencies are 

adopting proposed Q&A Mandatory 5 
and renumbering it as Q&A Mandatory 
4. 

Mandatory 5 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 6). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 6 discussed whether a lender 
is required to conduct an additional 
review of a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer under the 
mandatory acceptance provision if the 
policy includes the compliance aid 
assurance clause. The proposed answer 
stated that under the mandatory 
acceptance provision of the Regulation, 
if a policy or an endorsement to the 
policy contains the compliance aid 
assurance clause, a lender is not 
required to conduct any further review 
of the policy in order to determine that 
the policy meets the definition of 
‘‘private flood insurance.’’ The proposed 
answer also clarified that the language 
of the compliance aid assurance clause 
must be stated as set forth in the 
Regulation in order for the lender to rely 
on the protections of the compliance aid 
assurance clause. However, a lender 
need not reject a policy containing the 
compliance aid assurance clause if the 
formatting, font, punctuation, and 
similar stylistic effects that do not 
change the substantive meaning of the 
clause are different from the compliance 
aid assurance clause set forth in the 
Regulation. The proposed answer 
included a cross-reference to proposed 
new Q&A Mandatory 7. 

The Agencies received a specific 

comment on Q&A Mandatory 6 that was

supportive. The commenter agreed that 
if a policy or an endorsement to the 
policy contains the compliance aid 
statement, further review is not 
necessary in order for the lender to 
determine that a policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance.’’ 
Therefore, the Agencies are adopting 
this Q&A as proposed, other than 
amending the term ‘‘compliance aid 
assurance clause’’ throughout the Q&A 
to ‘‘compliance aid statement’’ to be 
consistent with the Regulation. The 
Agencies are also renumbering Q&A 
Mandatory 6 as proposed to Q&A 
Mandatory 5 and updating the included 
cross-reference. 

Mandatory 6 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 7). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 7 described additional 
reviews a lender must conduct when a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer includes the compliance 
aid assurance clause, as the clause only 
assists a lender in making the 
determination that a flood insurance 
policy meets the definition of ‘‘private 
flood insurance’’ in the Regulation, and 
not other requirements specified in the 
Regulation. Specifically, under the 
proposed answer, the lender also must 
ensure that the amount of insurance is 
at least equal to the lesser of the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
designated loan or the maximum limit 
of coverage available for the particular 
type of property under the Act. The 
answer also included a cross-reference 
to proposed new Q&A Mandatory 6. 

One commenter recommended that 
the Agencies revise Q&A Mandatory 7 
and include a new Q&A under the 
Private Flood Compliance section. This 
commenter understood that the 
Agencies are attempting to reassure 
lenders who may be reluctant to accept 
a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer merely because the 
policy includes the compliance aid 
statement. At the same time, the 
commenter believed that the Agencies 
do not want lenders to overlook the 
fundamental ‘‘requirements for 
coverage’’ review. Thus, the commenter 
suggested the Agencies simplify Q&A 
Mandatory 7 and move the language 
regarding coverage and other applicable 
requirements to a new Q&A under the 
Private Flood Compliance section. In 
addition, this commenter further 
recommended the Agencies include 
appropriate cross-references between 
Q&A Mandatory 7 and their suggested 
new Q&A, as well as to applicable 
questions under other sections. The 
Agencies disagree with this comment. 
Under the Regulation, lenders must 
determine whether a policy issued by a 
private flood insurance company meets 

both the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ and the required amount of 
insurance under the Regulation. The 
intent of proposed Q&A Mandatory 7 is 
to remind lenders that they must review 
the policy to ensure that it meets the 
amount of insurance required under the 
Regulation even if the policy includes 
the compliance aid statement. 

Many commenters had concerns with 

the sentence in the answer 
recommending that lenders ensure the 
accuracy of other key aspects of the 
policy, such as the borrower’s name and 
address. These commenters specifically 
found the phrase ‘‘key aspects of the 
policy’’ to be ambiguous, open-ended, 
extraneous, and potentially problematic 
and recommended either its deletion or 
amendment. Specifically, one 
commenter noted that because there are 
no statutory or regulatory requirements 
or references regarding this phrase or 
the included examples, this sentence 
could confuse lenders. Another 
commenter stated that the Agencies 
should clearly define the exact elements 
that lenders must review beyond the 
compliance aid statement. One 
commenter suggested that the Agencies 
instead instruct lenders to review the 
policy as they would review other 
insurance policies for safety and 
soundness. Further, one commenter 
explained that there are many valid 
reasons for differences between the 
named parties on a mortgage and a 
property insurance policy as well as for 
differences in the physical address of 
the property, especially if the mortgage 
system reflects the legal description for 
the property as opposed to a mailing 
address. 

The Agencies agree with the 

commenters that the phrase ‘‘other key 
aspects of the policy’’ is unclear. 
Because this sentence is not necessary 
to answer the question, the Agencies are 
deleting it in the final answer. Using 
alternative language regarding safety 
and soundness, as suggested by one 
commenter, would not eliminate 
ambiguity. However, the Agencies note 
that this deletion does not eliminate the 
need for lenders to conduct other 
reviews of a policy pursuant to their 
internal processes. 

One commenter requested that the 
Agencies use the term ‘‘limit’’ instead of 
the term ‘‘coverage’’ the first time it 
appears in the answer. The Agencies 
have considered this request and are 
changing this use of ‘‘coverage’’ to 
‘‘amount of insurance,’’ which is the 
phrase used in the Regulation. 

Additionally, the Agencies are adding 

a reference to the Regulation in the 
question in this Q&A to avoid further 
confusion. The Agencies also are 

amending the term ‘‘compliance aid 
assurance clause’’ throughout the Q&A 
to ‘‘compliance aid statement’’ to be 
consistent with the Regulation. 

With these changes, the Agencies are 

adopting this Q&A, renumbering it as 
Q&A Mandatory 6, and making a 
corresponding update to the included 
cross-reference. 

Mandatory 7 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 8). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 8 addressed whether a 
lender may use the criteria under the 
discretionary acceptance provision to 
decide whether to accept a policy that 
does not contain the compliance aid 
assurance clause without first reviewing 
the policy to determine if it meets the 
mandatory acceptance provision. The 
proposed answer clarified that a lender 
may first review the policy to determine 
whether it meets the criteria under the 
discretionary acceptance provision. 
However, if the policy is not accepted 
under the discretionary acceptance 
provision, the lender still needs to 
determine whether it must accept the 
policy under the mandatory acceptance 
criteria. The proposed answer also 
reminded lenders to document that a 
policy provides sufficient protection of 
the loan if the lender accepts the policy 
under the discretionary acceptance 
provision of the Regulation. 

The Agencies did not receive any 

specific comment on Q&A Mandatory 8. 
However, the Agencies are adding a 
cross reference to Q&A Discretionary 2 
regarding the documentation of the 
sufficient protection of the loan, which 
provides that the lender may document 
this information electronically. The 
Agencies also are amending the term 
‘‘compliance aid assurance clause’’ in 
the question to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. The Agencies are adopting 
Q&A Mandatory 8 with minor clarifying 
edits and renumbering as Q&A 
Mandatory 7. 

Mandatory 8 (Proposed as Q&A 
Mandatory 9). Proposed new Q&A 
Mandatory 9 noted that if the 
compliance aid assurance clause is 
included on the declarations page, a 
lender may accept the policy without 
further review to determine whether the 
policy meets the definition of ‘‘private 
flood insurance.’’ However, a lender 
also must ensure that the policy 
provides the amount of insurance as 
required under the Regulation. One 
commenter pointed out that many 
private flood insurance policies do not 
include this representation on the 
declarations page, but they do include it 
in the policy, and requested that the 
Agencies edit this Q&A to reflect this 
fact. The Agencies note that the

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Regulation provides that a lender may 
accept a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer if the compliance 
aid statement is in the policy. The 
purpose of the proposed Q&A was to 
provide guidance when a lender 
receives only the declarations page and 
not the policy. Therefore, to clarify this 
Q&A, the Agencies are changing the 
question to refer to the lender only 
receiving a declarations page without 
receiving a copy of the policy. 

Another commenter asked the 

Agencies to amend the response to make 
it clear that the lender may determine 
that the policy meets the definition of 
‘‘private flood insurance’’ without 
further review. The Agencies agree and 
have revised the answer as suggested by 
this commenter, which better reflects 
the language in the Regulation. 

One commenter stated that it would 
be helpful for the Agencies to identify 
in the answer the specific items that a 
lender must review to ensure 
compliance with the mandatory 
purchase requirement when the 
compliance aid assurance clause is 
included. The Agencies have addressed 
this issue in Q&A Mandatory 6 and 
included a cross-reference to Q&A 
Mandatory 6 in Q&A Mandatory 9. 
Therefore, the Agencies do not believe 
it is necessary to amend Q&A 
Mandatory 9 to include this 
information. 

Lastly, the Agencies are amending the 
term ‘‘compliance aid assurance clause’’ 
throughout the Q&A to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. 

With the changes described above, the 

Agencies are adopting this Q&A, 
renumbering it as Q&A Mandatory 8, 
and making a corresponding update to 
the included cross-reference. 

Mandatory 9 (Proposed as Private 

Flood Compliance 11). The Agencies are 
renumbering proposed Q&A Private 
Flood Compliance 11 as Q&A 
Mandatory 9 in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers because it more 
appropriately fits within the Mandatory 
Acceptance Q&A section. As proposed, 
this Q&A addressed whether a lender 
may accept a private flood insurance 
policy that includes a compliance aid 
assurance clause, but that also includes 
a disclaimer that the ‘‘insurer is not 
licensed in the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property is located.’’ The 
proposed answer explained 
circumstances under which lenders may 
accept a policy issued by an insurer that 
is not licensed in the State or 
jurisdiction in which the property is 
located. The proposed answer also 
included a cross-reference to proposed 
Q&A Private Flood Compliance 10, 

which addressed whether lenders may 
accept policies issued by private 
insurers that are surplus lines insurers 26 
for noncommercial residential 
properties. 

Some commenters suggested revising 

the answer to be more direct and to 
remove language that is addressed in 
Q&A Private Flood Compliance 10. The 
Agencies agree with the commenters 
that the answer can be worded more 
effectively and are adopting language 
similar to that recommended by one of 
the commenters. As revised, the answer 
provides that if the policy includes a 
statement indicating that the insurer is 
not licensed in the State or jurisdiction 
in which the property is located, 
suggesting that the policy is issued by 
a surplus lines insurer, but contains a 
compliance aid statement, lenders may 
accept the policy as long as the policy 
complies with the Regulation and 
applicable State laws. However, the 
Agencies note that the language 
removed from the proposed answer that 
provided specific circumstances under 
which lenders may accept a policy 
issued by a surplus lines insurer is still 
relevant. Specifically, a lender may 
accept a policy issued by a surplus lines 
insurer recognized or not disapproved 
by the relevant State insurance regulator 
as protection for loan collateral that is 
a commercial property. Also, a lender 
may accept a policy issued by a surplus 
lines insurer as protection for loan 
collateral that is a noncommercial 
property as a policy issued by an 
insurance company that is ‘‘otherwise 
approved to engage in the business of 
insurance by the insurance regulator of 
the State or jurisdiction in which the 
property to be insured is located.’’ 

The Agencies also are making one 

technical change to this question, 
amending the term ‘‘compliance aid 
assurance clause’’ to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. 

With the changes described above, the 

Agencies are adopting Q&A Mandatory 
9. 

26 The National Association of Insurance 

Commissioners (NAIC) notes, ‘‘[t]he surplus lines 
market (inclusive of U.S. and non-U.S. domiciled 
insurers) is a distinct segment of the industry 
consisting of non-admitted specialized insurers 
covering risks not available within the admitted 
market . . . Surplus lines insurers are subject to 
regulatory requirements and are overseen for 
solvency by their domiciliary [S]tate or country.’’ 
https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_surplus_
lines.htm. For specific definitions related to surplus 
lines insurers, lenders should review the State law 
in which the property is located. 

Section IV. Private Flood Insurance— 
Discretionary Acceptance 
(Discretionary) 

The 2019 Final Rule permits a lender, 

at its discretion, to accept a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer even if the policy does not meet 
the statutory and regulatory definition 
of ‘‘private flood insurance,’’ provided 
the policy meets certain requirements in 
the rule (discretionary acceptance). The 
2019 Final Rule also permits a lender, 
at its discretion, to accept certain 
mutual aid plans that meet the 
conditions stated in the rule. 

The Agencies proposed the Q&As in 

this section, except for Q&A 
Discretionary 4, in the March 2021 
Proposed Questions and Answers. The 
Agencies originally proposed Q&A 
Discretionary 4, as adopted in these 
2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers, as Q&A Coverage 1 in the July 
2020 Proposed Questions and Answers. 
The Agencies are combining proposed 
Q&A Discretionary 4 with proposed 
Q&A Mandatory 2 and renumbering this 
Q&A as Q&A Private Flood Compliance 
11, as discussed in more detail below. 

Discretionary 1. Proposed Q&A 
Discretionary 1 addressed whether 
lenders are required to accept flood 
insurance policies that meet the 
discretionary acceptance criteria. The 
proposed answer notes that the 
discretionary acceptance criteria in the 
Regulation set forth the minimum 
acceptable criteria that a flood insurance 
policy must have for the lender to 
accept the policy under the 
discretionary acceptance provision. The 
proposed answer clarified that it is at 
the lender’s discretion to accept a policy 
that meets the discretionary acceptance 
criteria so long as the policy does not 
meet the mandatory acceptance criteria. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comments on this Q&A and are adopting 
Q&A Discretionary 1 as proposed. 
Discretionary 2. Proposed Q&A 

Discretionary 2 addressed the 
requirements for documentation to 
demonstrate that a policy provides 
sufficient protection of a loan when a 
lender accepts that policy under the 
discretionary acceptance criteria. The 
proposed answer explained that the 
Regulation requires the lender to 
document its conclusion in writing that 
the policy provides sufficient protection 
of the loan, consistent with safety and 
soundness principles. In addition, the 
proposed answer included a cross- 
reference to Q&A Discretionary 4 which 
discusses some factors to consider when 
determining whether a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer 
provides sufficient protection of the

loan, consistent with safety and 
soundness principles.27 Furthermore, 
the proposed answer noted that while 
the Regulation does not require any 
specific documentation to demonstrate 
that the policy provides sufficient 
protection of the loan, lenders may 
include any information that reasonably 
supports the lender’s conclusion 
following review of the policy. 
One commenter on this Q&A 

suggested that the Agencies clarify that 
a lender’s electronic records may serve 
as documentation that demonstrates that 
a policy provides sufficient protection 
of the loan. The Agencies note that 
specific provisions in the Regulation 
allow for the use of electronic records. 
For example, the Regulation allows for 
the use of the Standard Flood Hazard 
Determination Form in an electronic 
format. Although there are no general 
provisions in the Regulation regarding 
the acceptability of electronic records, 
the Agencies agree that electronic and 
digital records are acceptable for a 
lender’s recordkeeping purposes. In 
consideration of this comment, the 
Agencies are amending the Q&A by 
adding that a lender’s review of a policy 
under the discretionary acceptance 
provision may be performed and 
recorded electronically. 

The second commenter asked the 

Agencies to clarify whether in situations 
where a loan is secured by a building 
and land, and the value of the land 
securing a loan is greater than the loan 
amount, the lender could determine that 
flood insurance is not required or that 
the deductible may be higher than what 
the mandatory purchase criteria allows. 
The Agencies note that the Regulation 
requires that flood insurance be at least 
equal to the lesser of the outstanding 
principal balance of the designated loan 
or the maximum limit of coverage 
available for the particular type of 
property, and that land is excluded from 
this analysis. Therefore, the lender 
cannot waive the flood insurance 
requirement based on the value of the 
land. Additionally, a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer must 
provide sufficient protection of the 
designated loan, consistent with general 
safety and soundness principles. When 

27 These factors include whether: (1) A policy’s 
deductibles are reasonable based on a borrower’s 
financial condition; (2) the insurer provides 
adequate notice of cancellation to the mortgagor 
and the mortgagee; (3) the terms and conditions of 
the policy with respect to payment per occurrence 
or per loss and aggregate limits are adequate to 
protect the lending institution’s interest in the 
collateral; (4) the flood insurance policy complies 
with applicable State insurance laws; and (5) the 
private insurance company has the financial 
strength, solvency and ability to satisfy claims. See 
85 FR 40442, 40458 (July 6, 2020). 

evaluating higher deductibles, lenders 
should ensure the deductible is 
reasonable considering the borrower’s 
financial condition. The Agencies 
believe that no change is needed in the 
Q&A to address this comment and that 
readers should refer to Q&A Private 
Flood Compliance 1. 

With the amendment described above, 

the Agencies are adopting Q&A 
Discretionary 2. 

Discretionary 3. Proposed Q&A 

Discretionary 3 addressed how a lender 
could evaluate concerns related to an 
insurer’s solvency, strength, and ability 
to pay claims in order to determine 
whether an insurance policy provides 
sufficient protection of a loan, 
consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles. The proposed 
answer provided that a lender may 
evaluate an insurer’s solvency, strength, 
and ability to satisfy claims by obtaining 
information from the State insurance 
regulator’s office of the State in which 
the property securing the loan is 
located, among other options. The 
proposed answer further indicated that 
a lender could rely on the licensing or 
other processes used by the State 
insurance regulator for such an 
evaluation. 

A number of commenters suggested 

that the Agencies provide additional 
examples for evaluating an insurer’s 
solvency, including the use of third- 
party sources of information such as 
credit rating agencies. Although lenders 
could consider many sources of 
information to evaluate an insurer, the 
Agencies decline to provide examples 
other than those included in the 
proposed Q&A. Further, including 
credit rating agencies as an example 
would be inconsistent with the 
principle in Section 939A of the Dodd- 
Frank Act, which required the Agencies 
to remove references to, or requirements 
of reliance on, credit ratings in their 
regulations with regard to assessment of 
the creditworthiness of a security or 
money market instrument using credit 
rating agencies. Although this provision 
concerns regulations, and not guidance, 
and is focused on the creditworthiness 
of a security or money market 
instrument, and not the solvency of an 
insurer, the Agencies believe it would 
be inappropriate to endorse or reference 
the use of credit rating agencies in the 
Interagency Questions and Answers in 
light of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. 

One commenter suggested that the 
Agencies remove the requirement for 
financial institutions to evaluate the 
solvency and strength of private flood 
insurers. The Agencies note that the 
Regulation does not require lenders to 

evaluate the solvency and strength of 
private flood insurers. Rather, it requires 
lenders to determine that the policy 
provides sufficient protection of the 
designated loan, consistent with general 
safety and soundness principles. 
Evaluating the solvency and strength of 
private flood insurers is one factor, 
among others, that lenders could 
consider in making this determination, 
as detailed in Q&A Discretionary 4 as 
adopted, discussed below. For these 
reasons, the Agencies are adopting the 
Q&A as proposed, with an update to the 
included cross-reference to reflect Q&A 
renumbering. 

Discretionary 4 (Proposed as Q&A 
Coverage 1). The Agencies proposed 
new Q&A Coverage 1 in the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers to 
assist lenders in complying with the 
discretionary acceptance provision and 
mutual aid societies provision in the 
Agencies’ final rule implementing the 
private flood insurance provision of the 
Biggert-Waters Act. As noted above, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Q&A as 
Discretionary 4. The Q&A provides 
additional information on some factors 
to consider when determining whether 
a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer provides sufficient 
protection of a loan. 

The Agencies received several 

comments on this Q&A. One commenter 
supported the Q&A because it is not 
overly prescriptive and will likely 
enhance the development of the private 
flood insurance market. A few 
commenters recommended that the 
Agencies clarify that the sufficient 
protection of a loan requirement only 
applies to the discretionary acceptance 
provision. The Agencies agree and are 
clarifying the question so that it 
specifically references the discretionary 
acceptance and mutual aid acceptance 
provisions. 

One commenter recommended that 

the Agencies expand the answer to 
explain that if a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer or flood 
endorsement to an insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer states that 
the policy meets the definition of 
private flood insurance under 42 U.S.C. 
4012a, or includes similar alternative 
language, such as that the coverage is at 
least as broad as the NFIP, the policy is 
explicitly acceptable. Additionally, the 
commenter suggested that if the flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
issuer is determined to be less than the 
coverage provided under an NFIP 
policy, and the policy states that 
coverage is amended to match the terms 
of an NFIP policy, that the policy is 
explicitly acceptable. The Regulation 
provides a specific compliance aid

provision to assist lenders in 
determining if a policy meets the 
definition of private flood insurance. 
While lenders may consider the 
alternative language noted above when 
reviewing flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers, making a 
policy acceptable based on such 
statements would not be consistent with 
the Regulation. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting proposed Q&A Coverage 1, 
renumbered as Discretionary 4, with the 
amendments discussed above. 

Section V. Private Flood Insurance— 
General Compliance (Private Flood 
Compliance) 

The Agencies proposed eleven new 
Q&As in this section in the March 2021 
Proposed Questions and Answers. As 
discussed in more detail above, the 
Agencies are renumbering proposed 
Q&A Private Flood Compliance 11 from 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers as Q&A Mandatory 9. Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 11, as 
adopted in these 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers, is a 
combination of proposed Q&A 
Mandatory 2 and proposed Q&A 
Discretionary 4 from the March 2021 
Proposed Questions and Answers. 

Private Flood Compliance 1. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 1 
addressed the maximum deductible 
permissible for a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer on properties 
located in an SFHA. The proposed 
answer clarified that the analysis 
depends on whether the lender is 
accepting the flood insurance policy 
under the mandatory acceptance 
provision or the discretionary 
acceptance provision. 

For a private flood insurance policy 
that the lender is accepting under the 
mandatory acceptance provision, the 
proposed answer stated that the 
Regulation provides that the policy 
must contain a deductible that is ‘‘at 
least as broad as’’ the maximum 
deductible in the SFIP under the NFIP, 
which means that the deductible is no 
higher than the specified maximum 
under an SFIP for any total coverage 
amount up to the maximum available 
under the NFIP at the time the policy is 
provided to the lender. Further, the 
proposed answer provided that a policy 
with a coverage amount exceeding that 
available under the NFIP may have a 
deductible exceeding the specific 
maximum deductible under an SFIP. 
However, the proposed answer also 
advised that for safety and soundness 
purposes, the lender should consider 
whether the deductible is reasonable 
based on the borrower’s financial 
condition, consistent with guidance the 

Agencies proposed in Q&A Amount 9 28 
and with how deductibles may be 
evaluated under the discretionary 
acceptance provision. The proposed 
answer also set forth examples to aid in 
compliance. 

Further, the proposed answer 

provided that for purposes of 
compliance with the discretionary 
acceptance provision, the Regulation 
requires that the policy provide 
sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles. The proposed 
answer stated that among other factors 
a lender could consider in determining 
whether the policy provides sufficient 
protection of the loan is whether the 
deductible is reasonable based on the 
borrower’s financial condition. The 
proposed answer further provided that 
unlike the limitation on deductibles for 
policies accepted under the mandatory 
acceptance provision for any total 
coverage amount up to the maximum 
available under the NFIP, a lender can 
accept a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer under the 
discretionary acceptance provision with 
a deductible higher than that for an SFIP 
for a similar type of property, provided 
the lender has determined the policy 
provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with general safety and 
soundness provisions. Finally, the 
proposed answer provided that whether 
a lender is evaluating the policy under 
the mandatory acceptance provision or 
the discretionary acceptance provision, 
a lender may not allow the borrower to 
use a deductible amount equal to the 
insurable value of the property to avoid 
the mandatory purchase requirement. 

The Agencies received several 

comments on this Q&A. One commenter 
asked for clarification of the flood 
insurance requirements for non- 
residential detached structures that are 
part of a commercial property and 
requested that the Agencies not limit the 
applicability of the detached structure 
exemption only to residential 
properties. The Agencies note that 
Congress established the detached 
structure exemption in HFIAA. This 
exemption provides that any structure 
that is part of a residential property but 
detached from the primary residential 
structure and does not serve as a 
residence is not required to be covered 
by flood insurance. As this statutory 
exemption only applies to a detached 
structure that is part of a residential 
property, the Agencies cannot create an 

28 Proposed Q&A Amount 9 provided that a 

lender should determine the reasonableness of the 
deductible on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
account the risk that such a deductible would pose 
to the borrower and the lender. 

exemption for detached structures that 
are part of a commercial property. 
Therefore, the Agencies do not have 
authority to revise the answer as 
requested. 

One commenter requested 

clarification regarding the deductible 
when multiple buildings are insured on 
a single insurance policy. Some other 
commenters requested clarification on 
how the statement in Q&A Amount 9 
referenced in the final paragraph of the 
proposed Q&A applies differently to a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer covering multiple 
individual buildings versus an NFIP 
policy, which is limited to covering a 
single building. In response to these 
comments, the Agencies are amending 
the answer to add language that 
provides that a lender may accept a 
private flood insurance policy covering 
multiple buildings regardless of whether 
any single building covered by the 
policy has an insurable value lower than 
the amount of the per occurrence 
deductible. The Agencies also are 
adding cross-references to new Q&A 
Amount 10 and Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 2, which address related 
deductible issues, to assist the reader. 
One commenter indicated that the 

Q&A should include guidance that 
directs private insurers to consider 
climate change risk when setting flood 
insurance deductibles. As discussed 
above, climate change risk is outside the 
scope of the Agencies’ Interagency 
Questions and Answers. As indicated 
previously, the Agencies are working 
individually and on an interagency 
basis to address financial risks 
associated with climate change 
consistent with the Agencies’ regulatory 
and supervisory authorities. Therefore, 
the Agencies decline to make any 
change to the Q&A in response to this 
comment. For clarity, the Agencies are 
rewording the reference to the 
deductible requirement in the 
Regulation. With this clarifying edit and 
the amendment as noted, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1. 

Private Flood Compliance 2. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 2 
clarified that a lender may require that 
the deductible of any flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer be 
lower than the maximum deductible for 
an NFIP policy, under both the 
mandatory acceptance provision and the 
discretionary acceptance provision. The 
proposed answer further stated that for 
the mandatory acceptance provision, the 
Regulation requires that the private 
flood insurance policy be at least as 
broad as an NFIP policy, which includes 
a requirement that the private flood

insurance policy contain a deductible 
no higher than the specified maximum 
deductible for an SFIP. Therefore, the 
proposed answer clarified that a lender 
may require a borrower’s private flood 
insurance policy deductible to be lower 
than the maximum deductible for an 
NFIP policy in connection with a policy 
that the lender accepts under the 
mandatory acceptance provision 
consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles and based on a 
borrower’s financial condition, among 
other factors. With respect to the 
discretionary acceptance provision, the 
proposed answer noted that the lender 
need only consider whether the policy, 
including the stated deductible, 
provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles. The proposed 
answer also included a reference to 
proposed Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1, which also addresses 
deductibles. 

A commenter requested that the 
Agencies include in the answer an 
example of when a lender is not 
required to accept a policy for safety 
and soundness reasons related to the 
deductible, such as when a deductible 
is too high based on the borrower’s 
financial condition. The Agencies 
decline to include an example in the 
answer because the answer already 
makes clear that a lender can require, as 
a condition of accepting the policy, a 
lower deductible for safety and 
soundness reasons. The Agencies note 
that the issues of deductibles as they 
relate to flood insurance policies issued 
by private insurers are already 
discussed in Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting this Q&A as proposed with 
some minor non-substantive edits. 

Private Flood Compliance 3. Proposed 

Q&A Private Flood Compliance 3 
provided guidance regarding whether a 
lender may charge fees to the borrower 
for the lender’s use of a third party to 
review flood insurance policies. The 
proposed answer provided that the Act 
and the Regulation do not prohibit 
lenders from charging fees to borrowers 
for contracting with a third party to 
review flood insurance policies, 
including a policy issued by a private 
insurer, and, as provided in Q&A Fees 
1 and Q&A Fees 2, lenders may charge 
limited, reasonable fees for flood 
determinations and life-of-loan 
monitoring.29 The proposed answer 

29 New Q&A Fees 1, which is adapted from 

current Q&A 69, lists the four instances in the Act 
and Regulation when a lender or servicer can 
charge the borrower a fee for making a flood 
determination. New Q&A Fees 2, adapted from 
current Q&A 70, provides that charges made for life- 

reminded lenders that they should be 
aware of any other applicable 
requirements regarding fees and 
disclosures of fees. 

A commenter suggested that the Q&A 

should be expanded to specifically 
speak to the lender’s ability to condition 
its acceptance of a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer on 
payment of a fee. The Agencies disagree. 
As provided in the Act and the 
Regulation, a lender is required to 
accept a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer that meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance,’’ 
as long as the policy meets the amount 
of insurance required under the 
Regulation. Therefore, a lender cannot 
condition the acceptance of such a 
policy on the payment of a fee by the 
borrower. Further, as stated above 
lenders should be aware of any other 
applicable requirements regarding fees 
and disclosures of fees. Therefore, the 
Agencies are adopting this Q&A as 
proposed with minor non-substantive 
edits. 

Private Flood Compliance 4. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 4 
addressed the lender’s responsibility to 
ensure a policy issued by a private 
insurer meets the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation if the policy is not available 
prior to loan closing. The proposed 
answer stated that the Act and 
Regulation do not specify the acceptable 
types of documentation for a lender to 
rely on when reviewing a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer. The proposed answer also 
advised lenders to determine whether 
they have sufficient evidence to show 
the policy meets requirements under the 
Regulation and that if the lender does 
not have enough information to make 
this determination, then the lender 
should timely request additional 
information as necessary to complete its 
review. The proposed answer also 
suggested some optional steps that a 
lender could take to mitigate against 
closing delays. 

The Agencies received a number of 
comments on this Q&A. Commenters 
asserted that lenders may not be able to 
obtain, before closing, a full policy or 
other information sufficient to 
determine whether a policy complies 
with the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation. The 
commenters suggested revising the 
answer to provide that a lender may 
close a loan without determining 
whether the policy satisfies these 
requirements and, if the lender later 

of-loan reviews by determination firms may be 
passed to the borrower under certain conditions. 

determines that the policy does not 
satisfy these requirements, the lender 
would then comply with the Act’s force- 
placed insurance requirements. The 
commenters also noted that with NFIP 
policies, lenders often rely on paid 
applications as evidence of coverage 
and receive a declarations page only 
after loan closing. 

The Agencies decline to make the 
changes the commenters request. If a 
borrower is obtaining a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer, the 
lender must determine whether the 
policy meets the requirements under the 
Regulation. If the lender cannot make 
this determination before closing on the 
loan, it may need to delay the closing. 
As discussed in Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 5, the declarations page, if 
available to the lender before closing, 
may provide enough information for the 
lender to determine whether the policy 
meets the mandatory acceptance 
provision or discretionary acceptance 
provision of the Regulation or may 
contain the compliance aid statement, 
in which case the lender may rely solely 
on the declarations page. Otherwise, the 
lender may choose to ask the borrower 
to obtain the necessary information from 
the private insurer to provide to the 
lender. 

Further, with respect to the 

commenter’s statement that with NFIP 
policies, lenders often rely before 
closing on paid applications for 
coverage and do not receive a 
declarations page until after closing, the 
Agencies note that an NFIP policy does 
not need to be evaluated to determine if 
it complies with the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation. In contrast, flood insurance 
policies issued by private insurers may 
not necessarily satisfy the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation. As indicated above, a lender 
must review such a policy to determine 
if it satisfies these requirements. 

Finally, commenters also requested 

that the answer distinguish its 
applicability to the two forms of review: 
The review of sufficiency for 
compliance with the mandatory 
purchase requirement and the review of 
acceptability under the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation. The intent of this Q&A is to 
remind lenders of their responsibility to 
ensure that a policy meets the private 
flood insurance requirements of the 
Regulation if the policy is not available 
prior to loan closing. It is not to address 
any of the other requirements in the 
Regulation. To clarify this, the Agencies 
are amending the Q&A so that it 
addresses only the private flood 
insurance requirements under the

Regulation and does not address any 
other flood requirements that the 
Regulation imposes. The Agencies also 
are adding in this Q&A a reference to 
Q&A Private Flood Compliance 5, to 
direct readers to guidance on whether a 
declarations page provides sufficient 
information for a lender to determine 
whether the policy complies with the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation. 

With the exception of the changes 

discussed above, the Agencies are 
adopting this Q&A as proposed. 

Private Flood Compliance 5. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 5 
addressed whether a declarations page 
provides sufficient information for a 
lender to determine whether a policy 
complies with the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation. Under the proposed answer, 
the lender may rely on the declarations 
page if it provides sufficient information 
for the lender to determine whether the 
policy meets the mandatory acceptance 
provision or the discretionary 
acceptance provision of the Regulation 
or if the declarations page contains the 
compliance aid assurance clause. 
However, if the declarations page does 
not provide sufficient information, the 
proposed answer suggested that the 
lender should request additional 
information about the policy to aid its 
determination. 

The Agencies received a number of 
comments on this Q&A. Similar to Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 4, the 
commenters asserted that the 
information lenders receive before 
closing may not be sufficient to 
determine whether the policy complies 
with the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation, even 
though it is sufficient to determine that 
the policy satisfies the mandatory 
purchase requirement, and they 
suggested revising the answer to provide 
that a lender may close a loan without 
determining whether the policy satisfies 
the private flood insurance 
requirements. If the lender later 
determined that the policy does not 
satisfy these requirements, the lender 
would then comply with the Act’s force- 
placed insurance requirements. For the 
reasons discussed in Private Flood 
Compliance 4, the Agencies decline to 
make the requested changes. 

Commenters further requested that 
the answer distinguish its applicability 
to the two forms of review: The review 
of sufficiency for compliance with the 
mandatory purchase requirement and 
the review of acceptability under the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation. The Agencies note that 
the focus of this Q&A is on the private 

flood insurance requirements of the 
Regulation and not any other flood 
requirements imposed by the 
Regulation. To clarify this, the Agencies 
are revising the question to specifically 
refer only to the private flood insurance 
requirements under the Regulation. 

Several of the commenters requested 

guidance about a lender’s authority to 
request necessary information from the 
borrower or insurer. The Agencies 
affirm that lenders may seek necessary 
information from borrowers and 
insurers. As discussed above, if a lender 
is unable to obtain the necessary 
information about a policy issued by a 
private insurer before closing, it may 
need to delay the closing. Another 
commenter suggested that the Q&A is 
unnecessarily limited by references to 
the declarations page and that that the 
Agencies should revise the Q&A to 
focus on the various forms of, and 
purposes for examining, evidence of 
coverage rather than emphasizing the 
declarations page. The Agencies note 
that this Q&A focuses on the 
declarations page because, prior to 
proposing this Q&A, the Agencies had 
received many questions requesting 
guidance on whether a declarations 
page provides sufficient information for 
a lender to determine whether a policy 
complies with the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation. Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 4 makes clear that the Act 
and Regulation do not specify the 
acceptable types of documentation on 
which a lender must rely when 
reviewing a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer. If the 
necessary information is contained in 
other appropriate documentation, the 
lender need not rely on the declarations 
page. 

The Agencies are adopting this Q&A 

as proposed, with the change to the 
question discussed above, and with one 
technical change to the answer that 
amends the term ‘‘compliance aid 
assurance clause’’ to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. 

Private Flood Compliance 6. The 
Agencies proposed new Q&A Private 
Flood Compliance 6 to provide 
guidance on a lender’s ability to accept 
multiple-peril policies. Specifically, the 
proposed answer clarified that a lender 
may accept multiple-peril policies that 
cover the hazard of flood under the 
private flood insurance provisions of the 
Regulation, provided they meet the 
requirements of the Regulation. 

A commenter requested that the Q&A 

clarify that lenders are permitted to 
accept both standalone multiple-peril 
policies that address flood risks and 

policies that insure against other risks 
and that have a flood-related 
endorsement, as long as the mandatory 
or discretionary provisions of the 
Regulation are otherwise satisfied. The 
Agencies agree that lenders may accept 
multiple-peril policies that either 
address flood risks in the policy itself or 
address flood risks as an endorsement to 
the policy, and have amended to answer 
to clarify this. 

The Agencies are also making a 
technical correction to this Q&A by 
removing the phrase ‘‘provided the 
policy meets the requirements under the 
Regulation.’’ This phrase is redundant 
because the private flood insurance 
provisions of the Regulation already 
require the policy to meet the 
Regulation’s requirements. 

The Agencies are adopting this Q&A 

with this amendment. 

Private Flood Compliance 7. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 7 
addressed the question of how the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation work in conjunction with 
requirements of secondary market 
investors, such as the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (Freddie Mac). The 
proposed answer first reminded lenders 
that they must comply with the Federal 
flood insurance requirements. The 
proposed answer then noted that 
secondary market investor requirements 
are separate from the requirements of 
the Regulation, and that, if a lender 
plans to sell loans to such an investor, 
the lender should carefully review the 
investor’s requirements and direct 
questions regarding these requirements 
to the appropriate entities. The Agencies 
did not receive any specific comment on 
proposed Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 7. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 7 as proposed, with one 
technical change to the question. 
Specifically, the Agencies are amending 
the term ‘‘compliance aid assurance 
clause’’ to ‘‘compliance aid statement’’ 
to be consistent with the Regulation. 

Private Flood Compliance 8. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 8 
provided guidance to servicers for loans 
covered by flood insurance mandated by 
the Act. Specifically, the proposed 
answer clarified that for loans serviced 
on behalf of lenders supervised by the 
Agencies, the servicer must comply 
with the Regulation in determining 
whether a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer must be accepted 
under the mandatory acceptance 
provision or may be accepted under the 
discretionary acceptance or mutual aid 
provisions. However, for loans serviced

on behalf of other entities not 
supervised by the Agencies, the 
proposed answer stated that the servicer 
should comply with the terms of its 
contract with such an entity. The 
proposed answer suggested that when 
servicing loans on behalf of Fannie Mae 
or Freddie Mac, where there are insurer 
rating requirements specified within 
those entities’ servicing guidance or 
other relevant authorities that are not 
included in the Regulation, the servicer 
should adhere to those servicing 
requirements. The Agencies did not 
receive any specific comment on 
proposed Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 8. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 8 as proposed. 

Private Flood Compliance 9. Proposed 

new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 9 
provided guidance regarding optional 
methods lenders can use to address 
questions on whether an insurer is 
licensed, admitted, or otherwise 
approved to do business in a particular 
State, which is one of the factors lenders 
must evaluate under both the mandatory 
acceptance and discretionary 
acceptance provisions. Specifically, 
proposed new Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 9 explained that a lender 
could determine whether an insurer is 
licensed, admitted, or otherwise 
approved in a particular State, or 
whether a surplus lines or nonadmitted 
alien insurer 30 is permitted to issue an 
insurance policy in a particular State, by 
reviewing the website of the State 
insurance regulator where the collateral 
property is located or by contacting the 
State insurance regulator directly. 
Further, the proposed answer noted that 
the information with respect to surplus 
lines insurer eligibility may be available 
in the Consumer Insurance Search (CIS) 
tool available on the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners 
(NAIC) website.31 The proposed answer 
stated that lenders also may consult 
commercial service providers regarding 
the eligibility of surplus lines insurers 
in particular States as long as the 
lenders have a reasonable basis to 
believe that these service providers have 
reliable information. With regard to 
nonadmitted alien insurers in 
particular, the proposed answer 

30 The NAIC notes that ‘‘[w]hereas [S]tates 
monitor the eligibility of U.S. domiciled surplus 
lines insurers, alien insurers eligible to write 
surplus lines premium are listed on the NAIC 
Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers [https://
www.naic.org/prod_serv_alpha_
listing.htm#quarterly_alien] . . . [Alien insurers] 
are prohibited from establishing a U.S. branch 
office.’’ https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_
surplus_lines.htm. 

31 See https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_

information.htm. 

suggested that lenders could review the 
NAIC’s Quarterly Listing of Alien 
Insurers.32 

The Agencies received one comment 

requesting that the Agencies allow 
financial institutions to rely on the 
regulated insurance companies to 
comply with the lender’s regulatory 
requirement to use a licensed insurance 
company because it is difficult to 
identify the insurer that is behind a 
specific flood insurance policy when 
the policy is issued by a syndicate of an 
alien insurer. As indicated above, if 
there is a compliance aid statement, and 
the lender is accepting the policy under 
mandatory acceptance, no further 
review is required to determine the 
status of the insurer. See Q&A 
Mandatory 6. However, the Agencies do 
not agree that the lender can waive its 
duty to verify whether an insurer is 
licensed, admitted, or otherwise 
approved in a particular State, or 
whether a surplus lines or nonadmitted 
alien insurer is permitted to issue an 
insurance policy in a particular State, if 
there is no compliance aid statement or 
if the lender is choosing to conduct its 
own review of whether the policy must 
be accepted under the mandatory 
acceptance provision or may be 
accepted under the discretionary 
acceptance provision. The Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 9 as proposed. 

Private Flood Compliance 10. 
Proposed new Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 10 addressed whether 
lenders may accept policies issued by 
private insurers that are surplus lines 
insurers for noncommercial residential 
properties. The proposed answer 
explained that if the surplus lines 
insurer is eligible or not disapproved to 
place insurance in the State or 
jurisdiction in which the property to be 
insured is located, lenders may accept 
policies issued by surplus lines insurers 
as coverage for noncommercial (i.e., 
residential) properties. In addition, the 
proposed answer confirmed that 
policies issued by surplus lines insurers 
for noncommercial properties are 
covered in the definition of ‘‘private 
flood insurance’’ and in the 
discretionary acceptance provision, 
which the Agencies noted in the 
preamble to the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers and in the 
proposed answer is consistent with the 
Act and the Regulation.33 Specifically, 

32 See https://www.naic.org/prod_serv_alpha_

listing.htm#quarterly_alien. 

33 During discussion of the Biggert-Waters Act on 
the Senate floor, Sen. Crapo noted that surplus lines 
insurers can provide flood insurance coverage for 
residential properties and asked for clarification 
regarding the inclusion of surplus lines coverage in 

the Agencies explained that in the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance,’’ 
surplus lines policies for 
noncommercial properties are covered 
as policies that are issued by insurance 
companies that are ‘‘otherwise approved 
to engage in the business of insurance 
by the insurance regulator of the State 
or jurisdiction in which the property to 
be insured is located.’’ The proposed 
answer also noted that within the 
discretionary acceptance provision, 
noncommercial residential policies 
issued by surplus lines carriers are 
covered as policies that are issued by 
private insurance companies that are 
‘‘otherwise approved to engage in the 
business of insurance by the insurance 
regulator of the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property to be insured is 
located.’’ 

As the Agencies discussed in the 
preamble to the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers, if the surplus 
lines insurer is eligible or not 
disapproved to place insurance in the 
State or jurisdiction in which a property 
to be insured is located, the surplus 
lines insurer is deemed to be ‘‘otherwise 
approved to engage in the business of 
insurance by the insurance regulator of 
the State or jurisdiction in which the 
property to be insured is located’’ for 
purposes of the Act and Regulation. 
Therefore, the proposed answer noted 
that even if the surplus lines insurer is 
not considered to be engaged in the 
business of insurance under applicable 
State law, the surplus lines insurer 
nevertheless would meet the criteria 
only for purposes of this provision of 
the Regulation if the insurer is eligible 
or not disapproved to place insurance in 
the State or jurisdiction in which a 
property to be insured is located. 

In the preamble to the March 2021 
Proposed Questions and Answers, the 
Agencies provided an example to 
illustrate this concept, noting that under 
section 1776 of the California Insurance 
Code, the permission granted to allow 
an insurance policy issued by a 
nonadmitted insurer to be placed in 
California, ‘‘shall not be deemed or 
construed to authorize any insurer to do 
business in [California].’’ 34 In addition, 

the definition of ‘‘private flood insurance.’’ In his 
response, Sen. Johnson stated, ‘‘[T]he definition of 
‘private flood insurance’ includes private flood 
insurance provided by a surplus lines insurer and 
is not intended to limit surplus lines eligibility to 
nonresidential properties. While the Senator is 
correct that surplus lines insurance is specifically 
mentioned in that context, overall the definition 
accommodates private flood insurance from 
insurers who are ‘licensed, admitted, or otherwise 
approved’ in the State where the property is 
located.’’ 158 Cong. Rec. S6051 (daily ed. Sept. 10, 
2012).

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

section 1776 of the California Insurance 
Code states that ‘‘[p]lacement activities 
of a licensed surplus line broker in 
accordance with [California law], 
including, but not limited to, policy 
issuance, shall not be deemed or 
construed to be business done by the 
insurer in [California].’’ 35 However, as 
discussed in the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers, it is the 
Agencies’ understanding that these 
provisions of California law do not 
make ineligible or disapprove any 
individual surplus lines insurer from 
placing insurance in California if they 
meet all other applicable requirements 
in California law. Consequently, a 
surplus lines insurer that is eligible or 
not disapproved to place insurance in 
California is ‘‘otherwise approved’’ for 
purposes of the Regulation even though 
the surplus lines insurer is not 
authorized to do business in California 
for purposes of Section 1776 of the 
California Insurance Code. 

Some commentors suggested that the 

Agencies consider removing or 
redrafting the Q&A because it suggests 
that lenders have an independent 
obligation to verify the eligibility of 
surplus lines insurers seeking to write 
flood coverage. The Agencies decline to 
make the suggested changes noting that, 
absent a compliance aid statement 
under the mandatory acceptance 
provision, the lender is required under 
the Regulation to verify the insurer’s 
eligibility, as discussed above in 
connection with Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 9. One commenter also 
suggested shortening the answer to only 
include the first sentence. The Agencies 
intentionally included the more detailed 
answer based on questions the Agencies 
have received and do not elect to 
shorten it. Therefore, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 10 as proposed with one 
minor non-substantive edit to the 
question. 

Private Flood Compliance 11 (Proposed 
as Q&As Mandatory 2 and Discretionary 
4). 

Proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 and 

proposed Q&A Discretionary 4 
addressed lender requirements for 
reviewing flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers. Because both 
proposed Q&As discussed similar 
issues, the Agencies are combining 
these two Q&As and renumbering them 
as Q&A Private Flood Compliance 11. 
Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 2 

addressed when a lender must review a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer to make sure the policy 

35 Id. 

meets the mandatory acceptance 
criteria, other than at loan origination. 
The proposed answer provided that 
other than at loan origination, a lender 
must review a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer to determine 
whether it meets the mandatory 
acceptance criteria when the policy 
comes up for renewal, or any time the 
borrower presents the lender with any 
new flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer. The proposed answer 
clarified that a lender must review the 
policy in these instances regardless of 
whether a triggering event occurred 
(making, increasing, extending or 
renewing a loan). 

The proposed answer further 

explained that a lender may determine 
that the policy meets the mandatory 
acceptance criteria without further 
review if the policy or an endorsement 
to the policy includes the compliance 
aid assurance clause and clarified that if 
the policy does not meet the mandatory 
acceptance criteria, the lender may still 
accept the policy if it meets the 
discretionary acceptance criteria, or, if 
applicable, the mutual aid plan criteria. 
The proposed answer indicated that if 
the policy does not meet the mandatory 
acceptance, discretionary acceptance, or 
mutual aid plan criteria, the lender must 
notify the borrower in accordance with 
the force placement provisions of the 
Regulation and further indicated that if 
the borrower does not purchase flood 
insurance that complies with the 
Regulation, the lender must purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf. 

The proposed answer also clarified 
that if a lender previously reviewed the 
flood insurance policy under the 
discretionary acceptance provision to 
ensure that the policy meets the private 
flood insurance requirements of the 
Regulation, the lender may rely on its 
previous review, provided there are no 
changes to the terms of the policy. 
However, as required by the Regulation, 
the proposed answer indicated that the 
lender must document its conclusion 
regarding sufficiency of protection of 
the loan in writing. 

Proposed Q&A Discretionary 4 

addressed whether a lender is required 
to review a flood insurance policy upon 
renewal if that policy was issued by a 
private insurer and was originally 
accepted in accordance with the 
discretionary acceptance provision. The 
proposed answer provided that if a 
lender had accepted a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer in 
accordance with the discretionary 
acceptance requirements and the policy 
is renewed, the lender must review the 
policy upon renewal to ensure that it 
continues to meet the discretionary 

acceptance requirements. The proposed 
answer also stated that a lender would 
need to document its conclusion 
regarding sufficiency of the protection 
of the loan in writing upon each 
renewal to indicate that the policy 
continues to provide sufficient 
protection of the loan. 

One commenter to proposed Q&A 

Mandatory 2 stated its belief that a 
private policy should be reviewed either 
at every policy renewal or when 
making, increasing, extending or 
renewing a loan but believes it would be 
best if the policy is reviewed when 
making, increasing, extending or 
renewing a loan. This commenter also 
stated that in connection with a renewal 
of a policy, a lender should be able to 
rely on its prior review in connection 
with mandatory acceptance to be 
consistent with the proposed answer to 
Q&A Mandatory 2 that allows a lender 
to rely on its prior review in connection 
with discretionary acceptance. Some 
commenters indicated that proposed 
Q&As Mandatory 2 and Discretionary 4 
suggest that there is a distinction 
between the level of review required in 
connection with making, increasing, 
extending or renewing a loan (triggering 
event) and the level of review required 
to accept a new policy during the loan 
term or renewal of the policy that had 
initially been accepted, and 
recommended that the Agencies revise 
the answers to clarify the level of review 
required in connection with a triggering 
event and the renewal of coverage. 
Some commenters noted that in 
connection with private flood 
insurance, a private flood insurance 
policy must be reviewed for both the 
acceptability of the policy (i.e., whether 
the policy meets the definition of 
‘‘private flood insurance’’) and 
sufficiency (i.e., the amount and term of 
coverage), and they requested guidance 
on whether there is a distinction 
between the review required in 
connection with a triggering event and 
upon renewal of the policy. One 
commenter appreciated the statement in 
proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 that ‘‘the 
lender may rely on its previous review, 
provided there are no changes to the 
terms of the policy’’ and recommended 
that the Agencies provide additional 
detail as to what elements of the prior 
review may be relied on during review 
of the same policy at renewal. Other 
commenters stated that proposed Q&A 
Mandatory 2 conflicts with proposed 
Q&A Applicability 8, which stated that 
‘‘[a]part from the requirements 
mandated when a loan is made, 
increased, extended or renewed, a 
lender need only review and take action

32845 

on any part of its existing portfolio for 
safety and soundness purposes, or if it 
knows or has reason to know of the 
need for NFIP coverage.’’ These 
commenters recommended that the 
Agencies clarify that a private policy 
must be reviewed upon the making, 
increasing, extending or renewing of a 
loan, and otherwise may be reviewed 
periodically consistent with safety and 
soundness principles. These 
commenters also suggested that the 
Q&A refer to acceptance ‘‘criteria’’ 
rather than ‘‘requirements’’ unless 
referring to a specific required action. 
The commenters noted that proposed 
Q&A Discretionary 4 draws a distinction 
between origination and renewal, yet 
there is no statutory requirement to 
review policies at renewal. The 
commenters suggested the Agencies 
remove the requirement that the lender 
must review the policy upon renewal, 
and instead state that the lender should 
have procedures to ensure that the 
policy continues to meet the 
discretionary acceptance criteria. 

Based on the comments, the Agencies 
agree that a lender should be able to rely 
at renewal on a prior review of a private 
policy in connection with mandatory 
acceptance and discretionary 
acceptance. Accordingly, the Agencies 
are combining the guidance contained 
in proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 with 
proposed Q&A Discretionary 4 and are 
removing the language in the first 
paragraph of the proposed answer to 
Q&A Mandatory 2 that would have 
required a lender to review a private 
policy to determine whether it meets the 
mandatory acceptance criteria when the 
policy comes up for renewal. To 
improve readability, the Agencies are 
removing the reference in proposed 
Q&A Mandatory 2 to ‘‘making, 
increasing, extending or renewing a 
loan’’ after the term ‘‘triggering event’’ 
in the first paragraph. Additionally, the 
Agencies are amending the term 
‘‘compliance aid assurance clause’’ in 
the first paragraph of proposed Q&A 
Mandatory 2 to ‘‘compliance aid 
statement’’ to be consistent with the 
Regulation. 

The Agencies also are revising and 
broadening the second paragraph of the 
answer to proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 
to provide that if a lender has 
previously reviewed the flood insurance 
policy under any of the private flood 
provisions of the Regulation—the 
mandatory acceptance provision, the 
discretionary acceptance provision, or 
the mutual aid plan provision, the 
lender may rely on its prior review, 
provided there are no changes to the 
terms of the policy that would affect 
acceptance under the Regulation. The 

Agencies also are removing the phrase 
‘‘to ensure that the policy meets the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation’’ in this paragraph of 
proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 because it 
is redundant. The answer for Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 11 provides 
that the lender should have effective 
internal controls in place through 
appropriate policies, procedures, 
training and monitoring to ensure 
compliance with the requirements of the 
Regulation. The Agencies interpret the 
Regulation to provide that when there 
are no changes to the terms of the policy 
that would affect acceptance under the 
Regulation, the lender’s previous 
written documentation will constitute 
the documentation required under the 
Regulation each time the policy comes 
up for renewal and are amending the 
answer to address this issue. The 
Agencies believe that the answer 
properly distinguishes ‘‘criteria’’ from 
‘‘requirements’’ under the Regulation 
and therefore decline to change this 
term as requested by the commenter. 

Finally, a few commenters to 

proposed Q&A Mandatory 2 stated that 
references to force placement in the 
proposed Q&A seemed unnecessary and 
further complicate the message as to the 
level of review needed upon the 
renewal of a private insurance policy. 
As the answer to Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 11 provides that in 
connection with a policy renewal a 
lender may rely on a previous review of 
the policy provided that there are no 
changes to the terms of the policy that 
would affect acceptance under the 
Regulation, the Agencies are not 
including the language regarding force 
placement that was proposed in Q&A 
Mandatory 2. 

With these amendments, the Agencies 

are adopting Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 11. 

Section VI. Standard Flood Hazard 
Determination Form (SFHDF) 

Proposed section IV included 

questions and answers related to use of 
the Standard Flood Hazard 
Determination Form (SFHDF). The 
Agencies proposed to move existing 
section XII to section IV for 
organizational purposes. Accordingly, 
this proposal redesignated existing 
Q&As 65 through 68 as Q&As SFHDF 1 
through 4, respectively. The Agencies 
proposed changes to the Q&As in this 
section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. Because the 
Agencies are combining the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one Interagency Questions 
and Answers document, the Agencies 

are renumbering this SFHDF section as 
Section VI in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers and 
streamlining the title. 

SFHDF 1. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 65 as Q&A 
SFHDF 1 with only minor language 
modifications and no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses whether the SFHDF replaces 
the borrower notification form. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting Q&A 
SFHDF 1 as proposed. 

SFHDF 2. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 66 as Q&A 
SFHDF 2 with only minor language 
modifications and no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses whether a lender may provide 
a copy of the SFHDF to the borrower. 
The Agencies received two comments 
on this proposed Q&A. Both 
commenters suggested removing the 
phrase ‘‘so they can better understand 
their flood risk’’ from the answer as the 
lender need not contemplate a 
borrower’s intended use of a flood 
determination and there may be other 
reasons for providing a flood 
determination to a borrower. One 
commenter suggested that references to 
FEMA’s Letter of Determination Review 
(LODR) process be removed from the 
answer as it falls outside the scope of 
the question. In consideration of the 
comments received, the Agencies are 
removing the language regarding the 
borrower’s understanding of their flood 
risk and limiting references to the LODR 
to note only that a lender would need 
to make a flood determination available 
to a borrower under this FEMA process. 
With these amendments and some 
minor non-substantive edits, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A SFHDF 2. 
SFHDF 3. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 67 as Q&A 
SFHDF 3 with only minor language 
modifications and no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses the use of an SFHDF in 
electronic format. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on this 
Q&A and are adopting Q&A SFHDF 3 as 
proposed. 

SFHDF 4. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 68 as Q&A 
SFHDF 4 with only minor language 
modifications and no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses the circumstances when a 
lender may rely on a previous SFHDF. 
The Agencies received one specific 
comment on this proposed Q&A. The 
commenter suggested clarifying the 
Q&A to note that an SFHDF may be 
reused for the same collateral on a 
subsequent loan secured by the same

collateral. The Agencies note that the 
existing Q&A states ‘‘if the same lender 
makes multiple loans to the same 
borrower secured by the same secured 
real estate, the lender may rely on its 
previous determination’’ if the other 
requirements referenced in the answer 
are satisfied. Therefore, no changes to 
the Q&A are needed to address this 
comment and the Agencies are adopting 
Q&A SFHDF 4 as proposed. 

Section VII. Flood Insurance 
Determination Fees (Fees) 

The Agencies proposed in the July 
2020 Proposed Questions and Answers 
to move existing section XIII, which 
contains questions and answers related 
to flood insurance determination fees, to 
proposed section V for organizational 
purposes. Because the Agencies are 
combining the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers and the March 
2021 Proposed Questions and Answers 
into one document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Fees section as 
Section VII in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. 

Fees 1. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing Q&A 69 as Q&A 
Fees 1 with only minor changes and no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses when a 
lender or servicer can charge a borrower 
a fee for making a flood determination. 
The Agencies did not receive any 
specific comment on proposed Q&A 
Fees 1, and are adopting it as proposed. 
Fees 2. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing Q&A 70 as Q&A 
Fees 2 with only minor changes and no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses whether 
charges made for life-of-loan reviews by 
flood determination firms may be 
passed along to the borrower. The 
Agencies did not receive any specific 
comment on proposed Q&A Fees 2 and 
are adopting it as proposed. 

Section VIII. Flood Zone Discrepancies 
(Zone) 

The Agencies proposed to redesignate 
the Q&As in existing section XIV, which 
addresses flood zone discrepancies, as 
section VI, and to redesignate current 
Q&As 71 and 72 as Q&As Zone 1 and 
2. The Agencies also proposed to add 
new Q&A Zone 3 to address borrower 
disputes of a lender’s flood zone 
determination. The Agencies proposed 
these changes in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. Because the 
Agencies are combining the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one document, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Zone 

section as Section VIII in the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 

One commenter said that it supported 
the changes to this section because it is 
frustrating for agents when lenders 
demand that specific flood zones appear 
on a declarations page; the commenter 
believes that lenders should be 
concerned only with whether the 
structure is in an SFHA and the limit on 
the policy. Another commenter stated 
that all three Q&As in this section 
provide consistent clarification that the 
SFHDF is the dominant form when 
discrepancies arise. 

Zone 1. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing Q&A 71 as Q&A 
Zone 1. Q&A 71 addresses what a lender 
should do when there is a discrepancy 
between the flood hazard zone 
designation on the flood determination 
form and the flood insurance policy 
declarations page. The Agencies 
proposed to revise the answer to Q&A 
71 to reflect a change in the Agencies’ 
expectations regarding a lender’s 
obligation in the event of such a 
discrepancy. The proposal stated that a 
lender is no longer required to attempt 
to resolve the discrepancy but that the 
lender should consider documenting the 
discrepancy in the loan file. The 
proposal further stated that if the flood 
determination form indicates that the 
building securing the loan is in an 
SFHA, the lender must require the 
appropriate amount of insurance 
coverage and is not otherwise required 
to attempt to resolve the discrepancy as 
previously indicated in current Q&A 71. 
Since the Agencies proposed Q&A 
Zone 1 in July 2020, FEMA has begun 
to implement Risk Rating 2.0 effective 
October 1, 2021.36 Under Risk Rating 
2.0, the determination of insurance 
premiums for NFIP policies no longer 
relies on the flood zone. As such, the 
flood zone is no longer included on the 
declarations page for NFIP policies 
issued under Risk Rating 2.0. Consistent 
with changes brought on by Risk Rating 
2.0, and after additional review, the 
Agencies are further revising this 
question and answer. Specifically, the 
Agencies are removing references to the 
declarations page and simplifying the 
answer to state that a lender need not 
reconcile or otherwise be concerned 
with a flood zone discrepancy to be in 
compliance with the Act and the 
Regulation. Finally, the Agencies are 
replacing references to the flood zone 
‘‘on the flood insurance policy 
declarations page’’ with the flood zone 

36 See https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/ 

risk-rating. 

‘‘associated with a flood insurance 
policy’’ as a clarifying change. 

Several commenters stated that they 

appreciate the Agencies’ change in 
position that a lender is no longer 
required to reconcile discrepancies 
between the SFHDF and the 
declarations page. 

Some commenters sought clarification 

of this proposed Q&A; they believed its 
language erroneously suggested that 
force placement is appropriate to cover 
a loss that has already occurred when a 
premium deficiency is discovered 
during the claim handling process. One 
commenter stated that the force 
placement requirement should apply 
during the life of the loan, whenever a 
discrepancy arises (such as with a 
policy renewal or replacement or a 
remapping event), not just if a 
discrepancy arises in connection with 
the making, increasing, refinancing, or 
extending of a loan (a triggering event). 
Another commenter stated that if 
permitted by the security instrument, a 
lender could satisfy its statutory and 
regulatory obligations by advancing the 
funds necessary to pay the additional 
premium. This commenter suggested 
adding language to the Q&A that would 
expressly permit this alternative. The 
Agencies note that lenders no longer 
need to be concerned with potential 
misratings resulting from an incorrect 
flood zone for NFIP policies due to 
changes made by FEMA in Risk Rating 
2.0; therefore, the Agencies are revising 
the final Q&A to reflect this change. 
A commenter asked if this Q&A 
should be understood to mean the 
lender is no longer required to send to 
the insurance agent and/or the 
underwriter a reminder of FEMA’s letter 
of April 18, 2008 (W–08021).37 Another 
commenter asked if the lender is 
allowed to continue the existing 
practice with respect to discrepancies, 
including providing notification to the 
insurance agent or company. A third 
commenter asked whether the guidance 
should speak to the lender addressing a 
discrepancy at the time it is discovered 
rather than at the time of a potential 
loss, which could benefit both the 
lender and the borrower. In response, 
the Agencies affirm that there is no 
expectation that lenders will continue 
the existing practice, or take any other 
action, with respect to discrepancies 

37 FEMA letter W–08021, dated April 16, 2008, 

set forth procedures for insurance companies 
relating to flood zone discrepancies. FEMA’s letter 
attached a Financial Institution Letter, FIL–114– 
2007, issued by the FDIC and dated December 21, 
2007, regarding managing risks associated with 
lapses in flood insurance coverage. FEMA letter W– 
08021 was archived in April 2018, and FIL–114– 
2007 was deactivated on December 1, 2018.

beyond what is described in this Q&A. 
The Agencies believe that Q&A 71, 
which sets forth expectations for 
resolving discrepancies, is 
unnecessarily burdensome. However, a 
lender is not prohibited from continuing 
the existing practice or otherwise 
attempting to resolve a discrepancy at 
any time. The Agencies are making no 
changes to the Q&A in response to these 
comments. 

A few commenters asked the Agencies 
to clarify that before it initiates the force 
placement process, the lender or 
servicer must first receive notice that 
the borrower is not paying the 
additional premium and must 
determine that the coverage is 
inadequate. As noted above, for NFIP 
policies, lenders no longer need to be 
concerned with potential misratings 
resulting from an incorrect flood zone 
due to changes made by FEMA in Risk 
Rating 2.0; therefore, the Agencies are 
revising Q&A Zone 1 accordingly. In 
light of these revisions, there is no 
longer a need to address these 
comments regarding force placement in 
this context. 

One commenter requested that the 
Agencies clarify that the reference to the 
‘‘appropriate amount of insurance 
coverage’’ refers to the dollar limit of 
flood insurance required. The Agencies 
confirm that this language refers to the 
dollar amount of the required insurance 
coverage. The Agencies are making no 
changes to the Q&A in response to this 
comment. 

One commenter sought clarification 
on how to handle zone discrepancies 
arising from flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers, and another 
commenter stated that providing 
flexibility on how discrepancies are 
resolved with regard to flood insurance 
policies issued by private insurers is 
important. The Agencies note that 
companies that issue private flood 
insurance policies have discretion in 
how they may require lenders to handle 
flood insurance discrepancies. 
Accordingly, the Agencies are unable to 
provide clarification or guidance on this 
matter. Lenders may want to contact the 
insurers for information. The Agencies 
are making no changes to the Q&A in 
response to this comment. 

One commenter asked the Agencies to 

add a statement regarding the 
acceptability of Newly Mapped rated 
policies that show a non-SFHA zone as 
the ‘‘rated’’ flood zone. The statement 
would provide that as long as the 
‘‘current’’ flood zone matches the 
lender’s determined zone, the policy 
satisfies the mandatory purchase 
requirement. The Agencies note that 
this request concerns FEMA policy, not 

Agency policy, and an Agency response 
to the request is beyond the scope of 
this Q&A. 

The Agencies are adopting Q&A Zone 

1 with the revisions discussed above. 
Zone 2. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate existing Q&A 72 as Q&A 
Zone 2. This Q&A addresses whether a 
lender is in violation of the Regulation 
if there is a discrepancy between the 
flood zone on the flood determination 
form and the policy declarations page. 
The Agencies proposed to revise this 
answer to reflect a change in the 
Agencies’ views on this question. The 
proposed Q&A clarified that a lender is 
not in violation of the Regulation if 
there is a discrepancy between the flood 
zone on the flood determination form 
and the flood zone on the policy 
declarations page. This proposed change 
is consistent with the change in the 
Agencies’ expectations regarding a 
lender’s obligation when there is a 
discrepancy between the flood 
determination form and the flood 
insurance policy, discussed in 
connection with Q&A Zone 1, above. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comments on proposed Q&A Zone 2 and 
are adopting it as proposed with two 
changes. First, as in Q&A Zone 1, the 
Agencies are replacing references to the 
flood zone ‘‘on the flood insurance 
policy declarations page’’ with the flood 
zone ‘‘associated with a flood insurance 
policy’’ to conform with changes made 
by FEMA in Risk Rating 2.0.38 Second, 
the Agencies are removing the language 
on documentation to reflect the changes 
made to Q&A Zone 1. 

Zone 3. The Agencies proposed new 

Q&A Zone 3 to explain what a lender 
should do when a borrower disputes the 
lender’s flood zone determination that a 
building securing the loan is located in 
an SFHA requiring mandatory flood 
insurance coverage. One commenter 
was strongly in favor of this Q&A. 
Another commenter appreciated the 
guidance and suggested adding 
emphasis in the first paragraph to the 
possible role of the flood determination 
vendor in resolving a dispute so that the 
dispute does not need to be elevated to 
FEMA. The Agencies encourage the 
parties to take appropriate actions to try 
to resolve disputes, and in some 
situations the appropriate actions could 
include seeking assistance from the 
vendor. However, the Agencies do not 
endorse particular actions, as 
appropriate actions are specific to 
particular situations. Accordingly, the 
Agencies are making no changes to this 
Q&A in response to this comment. 

38 See https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/ 

risk-rating. 

Another commenter said that 
although the Q&A is helpful, the 
statement that ‘‘sufficient coverage must 
be in place . . . until FEMA has 
determined that the building is not in an 
SFHA,’’ may result in significant closing 
delays. The commenter requested that 
the Agencies carefully consider this 
potential delay and evaluate potential 
opportunities to mitigate these negative 
effects. As the Regulation requires and 
the proposed Q&A states, if the lender’s 
flood determination specifies that a 
building securing the loan is located in 
an SFHA and requires mandatory flood 
insurance coverage, sufficient coverage 
must be in place until FEMA has 
determined that the building is not in an 
SFHA. The Agencies are unable to 
mitigate the effects of any delays in the 
FEMA review process and are making 
no changes to the Q&A in response to 
this comment. 

For the reasons discussed above, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A Zone 3 as 
proposed, with one minor edit to 
remove the reference to Q&A Zone 1. 

Section IX. Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards and Availability of Federal 
Disaster Relief (Notice) 

The Agencies proposed moving 

existing section XV to the proposed new 
section VII. This proposed new section 
includes existing Q&As 73 through 75 
and 78 through 80, which were 
redesignated as proposed Q&As Notice 
1 through 3 and Notice 5 through 7, 
respectively. Existing Q&As 76 and 77 
were combined into Q&A Notice 4. The 
Agencies proposed changes to the Q&As 
in this section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. Because the 
Agencies are combining the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one document, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Notice 
section as Section IX in the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 

Notice 1. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 73 as Q&A 
Notice 1, with minor language 
modifications for purposes of clarity 
with no change in meaning or 
substance. This Q&A explains that the 
Notice of Special Flood Hazards does 
not have to be provided to each 
borrower for a real estate related loan. 
In a transaction involving multiple 
borrowers, the lender need only provide 
the notice to any one of the borrowers 
in the transaction. The Agencies 
received one comment on this Q&A. The 
commenter asked the Agencies to clarify 
whether an electronic notice must meet 
the requirements of the Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National 
Commerce Act (E-Sign Act). The

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Agencies find that the requirements of 
the E-Sign Act are outside the scope of 
the Q&As and are adopting Q&A Notice 
1 as proposed. 

Notice 2. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 74 as Q&A 
Notice 2. This Q&A discusses the notice 
requirement for lenders making loans on 
mobile homes. In the proposal, the 
Agencies proposed to amend the Q&A to 
conform more closely to the Regulation. 
Proposed Q&A Notice 2 states that a 
lender must provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower 
within a reasonable time before the 
completion of the transaction, even if 
the lender only learns where the mobile 
home will be located just prior to 
closing and delivery of the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards would delay 
closing. 

The Agencies received a number of 
comments for this Q&A. The majority of 
commenters to this Q&A asked the 
Agencies to further define ‘‘reasonable 
time.’’ One commenter stated that 
proper compliance with the Regulation 
should not be dependent on an 
inconsistent interpretation of 
‘‘reasonable time’’ from each of the 
Agencies. Another commenter believed 
lenders were frequently cited for not 
timely providing the Notice of Special 
Flood Hazards, even though no specific 
time frame is included in the Act or 
Regulation. This commenter cautioned 
the Agencies against using a time frame 
that would be unreasonable in certain 
situations, such as a refinance. A third 
commenter stated that it is common for 
a lender to receive an updated flood 
determination less than 10 days before 
closing. In such a case, the commenter 
suggested that ‘‘reasonable’’ would be 
the time between the revised finding 
and closing. 

The Agencies also received two 

comments requesting the addition of a 
new Q&A to address the timing of when 
a lender must provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower. 
One commenter pointed out that the 
same comment was made in 2009 and 
stated that there should be an explicit 
reference to the fact that a notice period 
of fewer or greater than 10 days may 
also be ‘‘reasonable’’ according to 
circumstances. Another commenter 
noted that while a ten-day notice period 
is not a requirement of the Regulation, 
the ten-day period appears to be a well- 
established and generally accepted time 
period. Therefore, this commenter 
recommended the Agencies incorporate 
a new Q&A and provided sample 
language. 

The Agencies acknowledge the 

difficulties lenders face with no defined 
period in the Act or the Regulation and 

have decided to modify the final Q&A 
Notice 2 to further define ‘‘reasonable 
time.’’ Therefore, in the final Q&A, the 
Agencies are incorporating language 
from the Interagency Examination 
Procedures for the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act 39 and the preamble to 
the 2009 Interagency Questions and 
Answers, both of which provided 
guidance on what constitutes a 
‘‘reasonable’’ notice. This language is 
similar to the commenter’s suggested 
language for a new Q&A. 

Specifically, the Agencies are making 
three changes to the final Q&A Notice 2. 
First, the Agencies are revising the 
question to ask when a lender should 
provide the Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards to the borrower, and how this 
requirement applies in situations 
regarding mobile homes where the 
lender may not know where the home 
is to be located until just prior to, or 
sometimes after, the time of loan 
closing. Second, the Agencies are 
amending the answer to state that what 
constitutes ‘‘reasonable’’ notice will 
necessarily vary according to the 
circumstances of particular transactions. 
A lender should bear in mind, however, 
that a borrower should receive a timely 
notice to ensure that (1) the borrower 
has the opportunity to become aware of 
the borrower’s responsibilities under the 
Act; and (2) where applicable, the 
borrower can purchase flood insurance 
before completion of the loan 
transaction. Lastly, the Agencies are 
revising the answer to state that the 
Agencies generally regard 10 calendar 
days before loan closing as a 
‘‘reasonable’’ time interval. 

In addition to comments regarding 

‘‘reasonable time,’’ one commenter 
asked the Agencies to amend their 
examination manuals to reflect how 
lenders and/or their servicers are 
frequently unaware of mobile home 
movement(s) and may only learn of 
changes afterwards. The commenter 
wanted the examination manuals to 
align examiner methods with the 
realities of the business processes. The 
commenter explained that ‘‘home only’’ 
transactions, where loans are secured by 
mobile homes not located on a 
permanent foundation, raise safety and 
soundness concerns for lenders. The 
Agencies do not believe this information 
is appropriate for their examination 
manuals. These types of situations are 
fact specific and cannot be addressed in 
the Interagency Questions and Answers 
or examination guidance. 

39 The Task Force on Consumer Compliance of 
the FFIEC adopted revised interagency examination 
procedures for the Flood Disaster Protection Act in 
2019. All of the Agencies, except the FCA, are 
members of the FFIEC. 

Another commenter preferred the 
existing Q&A 74 as written, rather than 
the proposed Q&A Notice 2. This 
commenter believed that existing Q&A 
74 gives the lender flexibility to provide 
the Notice of Special Flood Hazards to 
the borrower ‘‘as soon as practicable 
after determination that the mobile 
home will be located in an SFHA,’’ and 
it further provided that ‘‘lenders should 
use their best efforts to provide adequate 
notice of flood hazards to borrowers’’ as 
early as possible. The commenter stated 
that the existing Q&A 74 allows lenders 
the flexibility to incorporate their flood 
insurance compliance into the realities 
experienced in their business 
operations. The commenter 
recommended the Agencies revise this 
Q&A to retain this flexibility. As stated 
in the July 2020 Proposed Questions 
and Answers, the purpose of the 
proposed changes to existing Q&A 74 is 
to conform to the Regulation. The 
proposed answer, with the changes 
explained above, is consistent with the 
Regulation, and the Agencies decline to 
make any further changes that would be 
inconsistent with the Regulation. 

Notice 3. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 75 as Q&A 
Notice 3 with no changes. This Q&A 
addresses when the lender is required to 
provide notice to the servicer of a loan 
that flood insurance is required. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting the Q&A 
as proposed. 

Notice 4. The Agencies proposed to 
consolidate existing Q&As 76 and 77 for 
organizational reasons into Q&A Notice 
4, with no substantive changes. This 
Q&A discusses the appropriate form of 
notice to the servicer and whether it is 
necessary to provide a notice to a 
servicer affiliated with the lender. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
to this Q&A and are adopting the Q&A 
as proposed. 

Notice 5. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 78 as Q&A 
Notice 5. This Q&A considers how long 
a lender must maintain the record of 
receipt by the borrower of the notice. 
The Agencies proposed amending this 
Q&A to list examples of what 
constitutes an acceptable record of 
receipt. The Agencies received one 
specific comment for proposed Q&A 
Notice 5. This commenter stated this 
proposed Q&A acknowledges that 
borrowers may be provided with an 
electronic notice. Therefore, this 
commenter recommended that for 
further clarity, the Agencies add an 
electronic example to the list in the 
answer. The Agencies agree with the 
commenter and are revising the 
answer’s list of examples to include the

as proposed, with minor non- 
substantive edits. 

Notice 6. The Agencies proposed to 

Amount 2. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 79 as Q&A 
Notice 6, with non-substantive edits to 
provide additional clarity. This Q&A 
addresses whether a lender can rely on 
a previous notice if it is less than seven 
years old and it is the same property, 
same borrower, and same lender. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting it as 
proposed with one minor non- 
substantive edit. 

Notice 7. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 80 as Q&A 
Notice 7 with non-substantive edits to 
provide additional clarity. This Q&A 
discusses whether the use of the sample 
form notice is mandatory. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on this 
Q&A and are adopting it as proposed. 

Section X. Determining the Appropriate 
Amount of Flood Insurance Required 
(Amount) 

The Agencies proposed moving 

existing section II to a new section VIII 
and amending the section heading for 
streamlining purposes. The Agencies 
also proposed to redesignate existing 
Q&As 8, 9 and 11 through 17 as Amount 
1, Amount 2, and Amount 3 through 9 
respectively. The Agencies proposed 
changes to the Q&As in this section in 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. Because the Agencies are 
combining the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers and the March 
2021 Proposed Questions and Answers 
into one document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Amount section as 
Section X in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. 

Amount 1. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 8 as Q&A 
Amount 1. This Q&A addresses the 
maximum limit of coverage available for 
the particular type of property under the 
Act. The Agencies proposed to revise 
this Q&A to discuss NFIP coverage 
limits more fully and to include 
coverage for condominiums and 
contents coverage. One commenter 
suggested that the Agencies address 
commercial condominiums in the listed 
examples of coverage amount 
calculations to clarify that the NFIP 
does not provide coverage for such units 
other than contents coverage. The 
Agencies agree that clarification is 
needed with respect to non-residential 
condominiums and have added a new 
Q&A in Section XII, Q&A Condo and 
Co-Op 9, to clarify that there is no 
mandatory purchase requirement for a 
loan secured by an individual non- 
residential condominium unit. The 
Agencies are adopting Q&A Amount 1 

redesignate existing Q&A 9, which 
defines ‘‘insurable value,’’ to Q&A 
Amount 2. The Agencies proposed to 
remove references in this Q&A to the 
rescinded FEMA Mandatory Purchase of 
Flood Insurance Guidelines and to 
provide greater clarity with no intended 
change in substance or meaning. One 
commenter requested clarification as to 
whether a lender or servicer may rely on 
the replacement cost value listed on the 
flood insurance policy declarations page 
to establish ‘‘insurable value.’’ The 
Agencies are revising the final answer to 
clarify that a lender may rely on the 
replacement cost value stated on the 
declarations page if the declarations 
page includes such information. As 
noted in the proposed Q&A, the 
Agencies recognize that the ‘‘insurable 
value’’ of a building may be established 
by any reasonable approach, as long as 
such approach can be supported. 

Several commenters noted that since 
most home hazard insurance policies do 
cover foundations, the insurable value 
on a home hazard insurance policy may 
align with a flood insurance policy 
without the need for an adjustment. 
Based on the comment received, the 
Agencies have revisited the proposed 
answer and are removing the language 
that stated that hazard policies do not 
cover foundations in the final answer. 
Some commenters raised concerns 
about language in the second paragraph 
in this Q&A that indicated that it would 
be reasonable for lenders, in 
determining the amount of flood 
insurance required, to consider the 
extent of recovery allowed under the 
NFIP or a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer for the type of 
property being insured. These 
commenters noted that the settlement 
basis for an insurance policy is a 
separate and distinct concept from the 
insurable value of a building and has no 
impact on insurable value. While the 
Agencies had included such language in 
the answer to provide further 
background, the Agencies believe 
information on the extent of recovery 
allowed under the NFIP or a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer is not necessary to answer the 
question. Accordingly, the Agencies are 
deleting this language in the final Q&A. 
The Agencies are adopting proposed 
Q&A Amount 2 with the revisions 
discussed above. 

Amount 3. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 11, which 
provides examples of residential 
buildings, as Q&A Amount 3. The 
Agencies proposed to revise this Q&A to 

include more detailed definitions from 
the NFIP Flood Insurance Manual of the 
terms: single family dwelling, 2–4 
family residential building, and other 
residential building. The Agencies did 
not receive any specific comment on 
proposed Q&A Amount 3. Additionally, 
the Agencies note that the proposed 
answer was based on language included 
in an earlier version of the NFIP Flood 
Insurance Manual and that the manual 
has since been revised. Accordingly, the 
Agencies are making some non- 
substantive edits to the final answer to 
be consistent with the terminology used 
in the most recent version of the NFIP 
Flood Insurance Manual. The Agencies 
are adopting this Q&A as proposed, 
subject to edits noted above. 

Amount 4. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 12, which 
provides examples of non-residential 
buildings, as Q&A Amount 4. The 
Agencies proposed to revise this Q&A to 
provide a more detailed definition of 
non-residential building based on the 
NFIP Flood Insurance Manual. A few 
commenters requested that the Agencies 
revise the answer to remove the 
language stating that a non-residential 
building is one in which the named 
insured is a commercial enterprise. To 
address this comment, the Agencies are 
adding language in the answer to clarify 
that the description of a non-residential 
building is based on language in the 
NFIP Flood Insurance Manual and are 
revising the answer to more clearly 
indicate that the building need not be 
one in which the named insured is a 
commercial enterprise. Another 
commenter requested that the Agencies 
clarify that the lender may rely on 
borrower or agent assertions as to 
percentage of residential and 
commercial usage of a given property. 
The Agencies note that although a 
lender may rely on borrower or agent 
assertions as to percentage of residential 
and commercial usage of a given 
property, such language is not included 
in the NFIP Flood Insurance Manual. 
Therefore, the Agencies do not believe 
it would be appropriate to add such 
language to the answer. 

Additionally, the Agencies note that 

the language in the proposed answer 
was based on language included in an 
earlier version of the NFIP Flood 
Insurance Manual and that the manual 
has since been revised. Accordingly, the 
Agencies are revising the final answer to 
be consistent with the most recent 
version of the NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual. The Agencies are adopting the 
Q&A as proposed, subject to the edits 
discussed above and minor non- 
substantive edits.

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Amount 5. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 13 as Q&A 
Amount 5 and to revise it to provide 
greater clarity with no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses how much insurance is 
required on a building located in an 
SFHA in a participating community. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comment on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed, with a minor non- 
substantive edit. 

Amount 6. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 14 as Q&A 
Amount 6 and to revise it to provide 
greater clarity with no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses flood insurance requirements 
when the real estate security contains 
more than one building located in an 
SFHA in a participating community. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comment on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed, with a minor non- 
substantive edit. 

Amount 7. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 15 as Q&A 
Amount 7 and to revise it by making 
minor language modifications, with no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses the flood 
insurance requirements where the 
insurable value of a building or mobile 
home securing a designated loan is less 
than the outstanding principal balance 
of the loan. The last sentence in this 
Q&A states that since the NFIP policy 
does not cover land value, lenders 
determine the amount of insurance 
necessary based on the insurable value 
of the improvements. One commenter 
suggested that the Agencies change 
‘‘improvements’’ to ‘‘building’’ because 
‘‘improvements’’ would include items 
that, like land itself, are not insurable 
under the NFIP for flood loss, such as 
fencing or paving. The Agencies agree 
with the commenter and are revising the 
final answer accordingly. The Agencies 
otherwise are adopting Q&A Amount 7 
as proposed. 

Amount 8. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 16 as Q&A 
Amount 8 and to revise it to provide 
greater clarity with no intended change 
in substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses whether a lender may require 
more flood insurance than the minimum 
required by the Regulation. The 
Agencies received no specific comment 
on this Q&A and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Amount 9. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 17 as Q&A 
Amount 9 and to revise it by making 
minor language modifications, with no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses lender 
considerations regarding the amount of 

the deductible on a flood insurance 
policy purchased by a borrower. One 
commenter recommended that the 
Agencies add language to Q&A Amount 
9 to clarify that the answer refers to the 
maximum deductible offered by the 
NFIP as some private insurers offer 
higher deductibles than are offered 
under the NFIP. The Agencies decline to 
make this change as Q&A Amount 9 is 
not limited to policies issued by the 
NFIP. 

Related to the topic addressed in Q&A 

Amount 9, one commenter 
recommended that the Agencies include 
a new Q&A that describes the function 
of a deductible and explains the role of 
the deductible in a safety and soundness 
consideration rather than discussing the 
deductible as related to the adequacy of 
coverage in satisfaction of the 
mandatory purchase requirement. The 
Agencies decline to add a new Q&A to 
address this topic as the topic is outside 
the scope of these Interagency Questions 
and Answers. Another commenter 
raised an issue that is related to, but 
distinct from the issue addressed in 
Q&A Amount 9. To address the issue 
raised by this commenter, the Agencies 
have added new Q&A Amount 10, 
discussed below. The Agencies 
therefore are adopting Q&A Amount 9 
as proposed. 

New Amount 10. In response to a 
comment raised on proposed Q&A 
Amount 9 that is related to, but distinct 
from the issue addressed in Q&A 
Amount 9, the Agencies have added 
new Q&A Amount 10. This commenter 
noted that the Agencies originally based 
the answer included in Q&A Amount 9 
on guidance which assumed that the 
property is a single building covered by 
a single flood insurance policy. 
However, this commenter noted that it 
is common for flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers to include 
multiple buildings of varying value. The 
commenter recommended that the Q&A 
clarify that it is acceptable to have 
buildings or structures included on the 
policy that have a value lower than the 
deductible amount of the policy. The 
commenter also recommended that the 
Agencies provide that the lender may 
not allow the borrower to use a 
deductible amount equal to the 
aggregate insurable value of the property 
to avoid the mandatory purchase 
requirement for flood insurance. The 
Agencies recognize that many flood 
insurance policies issued by private 
insurers, such as blanket insurance 
policies purchased by some commercial 
borrowers, are single policies that 
provide coverage for: (i) Two or more 
kinds of properties in the same location; 
(ii) the same kind of property in two or 

more locations; or (iii) two or more 
different kinds of properties in two or 
more locations. Blanket policies often 
cover multiple perils such as flood, 
earthquake, fire, etc. and are often used 
to insure commercial real estate such as 
multifamily housing, office buildings, 
hotels, or resorts. Such blanket multi- 
peril policies may also be used to insure 
a company’s chain of locations or 
franchised properties. 

The Agencies understand that 

generally, the deductible for a blanket 
flood insurance policy or multi-peril 
policy is in the form of a per-occurrence 
deductible that is applied to the covered 
loss arising from that occurrence. For 
example, a flood event that damages 
multiple buildings covered by this type 
of blanket flood insurance or multi-peril 
policy would incur the deductible once, 
not per building, and buildings covered 
under the terms of this type of policy 
are insured by the policy regardless of 
the policy deductible amount. The 
Agencies further understand that these 
types of private blanket flood insurance 
policies and blanket multi-peril policies 
provide coverage for each building 
covered by such a policy, without 
regard to the deductible and regardless 
of whether any individual building 
covered under the policy has a value 
that may be lower than the amount of 
the deductible. 

Accordingly, the Agencies have 
included new Q&A Amount 10 to 
address the acceptability of a blanket 
flood insurance policy or blanket multi- 
peril policy that includes a deductible 
that may be higher than the insurable 
value of any individual building 
covered by the policy. The Q&A 
provides that a lender may accept a 
blanket flood insurance policy or 
blanket multi-peril policy that includes 
a per-occurrence deductible, regardless 
of whether any building covered by the 
policy has an insurable value lower than 
the amount of the deductible. The 
answer also provides that a lender may 
not allow the borrower to use a 
deductible amount equal to the 
aggregate insurable value of the property 
to avoid the mandatory purchase 
requirement. In addition, the answer 
provides that a lender should determine 
the reasonableness of the deductible on 
a case-by-case basis, taking into account 
the risk that such deductible would 
pose to the borrower and the lender. 

Section XI. Flood Insurance 
Requirements for Construction Loans 
(Construction) 

The Agencies proposed to move the 
prior section IV to the new section IX 
and redesignated prior Q&As 19 through 
23 as Q&As Construction 1 through 5,

respectively, and added a new 
construction-related Q&A, as Q&A 
Construction 6. The Agencies proposed 
changes to the Q&As in this section in 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. Because the Agencies are 
combining the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers and the March 
2021 Proposed Questions and Answers 
into one document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Construction section 
as Section XI in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. 

Construction 1. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
19 as Q&A Construction 1 and to make 
minor non-substantive wording changes 
for clarity. This Q&A addresses the 
applicability of the flood insurance 
requirements to a loan secured only by 
land that will be developed into 
buildable lot(s). The Agencies did not 
receive any specific comment on Q&A 
Construction 1 and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Construction 2. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
20 as Q&A Construction 2 and to make 
minor wording changes for clarity. This 
Q&A addresses whether a loan secured 
or to be secured by a building in the 
course of construction that is located or 
to be located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act is 
a designated loan. The Agencies did not 
receive any specific comment on Q&A 
Construction 2 and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Construction 3. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
21 as Q&A Construction 3 and to the 
revise the language by removing direct 
reference to the NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual with no intended change in 
substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses whether a building in the 
course of construction that is located in 
an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act is eligible for 
coverage under an NFIP policy. The 
Agencies received two comments on 
this Q&A. One commenter suggested 
that the Agencies edit the question to 
clarify that it is describing when 
construction is covered against loss by 
an NFIP policy. The commenter 
explained that the word ‘‘eligible’’ as 
used in the question could refer to the 
obligation to obtain insurance under the 
rule or coverage being effective under 
the policy. The Agencies clarify that 
proposed Q&A Construction 3 is 
addressing eligibility for coverage and 
not the obligation to obtain coverage nor 
the effectiveness of the coverage. The 
Agencies are revising the answer in final 
Q&A Construction 3 to explain when 
the NFIP will insure a building in the 
course of construction based on when 

the building is walled and roofed as 
well as when materials or supplies are 
eligible for coverage. 

A commenter suggested that the 
answer to this Q&A, which states that 
‘‘buildings in the course of construction 
that have yet to be walled and roofed are 
eligible for coverage except when 
construction has been halted for more 
than 90 days,’’ does not accurately 
describe what happens to NFIP coverage 
when construction is halted. 
Specifically, this commenter requested 
that the Agencies clarify that NFIP 
coverage ceases on day 91 of halted 
construction, as provided in the NFIP 
Flood Insurance Manual, and not on the 
day construction is halted for a period 
exceeding 90 days. In response to this 
comment, the Agencies are revising the 
answer in final Q&A Construction 3 to 
include the specific language from the 
NFIP Flood Insurance Manual that 
details the effect of a halt in 
construction on NFIP coverage. 
Specifically, buildings in the course of 
construction that are not walled and 
roofed are not eligible for coverage 
when construction stops for more than 
90 days and/or if the lowest floor for 
rating purposes is below the Base Flood 
Elevation. 

With these changes, the Agencies are 

adopting Q&A Construction 3. 

Construction 4. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
22 as Q&A Construction 4. This Q&A 
addresses when a lender must require 
the purchase of flood insurance for a 
loan secured by a building in the course 
of construction that is located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available. As in existing Q&A 22, the 
proposed answer provides that a lender 
may either require borrowers to have a 
flood insurance policy in place at the 
time of loan origination or allow a 
borrower to defer the purchase of flood 
insurance until either after a foundation 
slab has been poured and/or an 
Elevation Certificate has been issued or, 
if the building to be constructed will 
have its lowest floor below the Base 
Flood Elevation, when the building is 
walled and roofed. However, when 
flood insurance is deferred, the lender 
must require the borrower to have flood 
insurance in place before the lender 
disburses funds to pay for building 
construction (except as necessary to 
pour the slab or perform preliminary 
site work, such as laying utilities, 
clearing brush, or the purchase and/or 
delivery of building materials). 

The Agencies proposed to revise the 

answer to incorporate the NFIP’s 
removal of the waiver of the 30-day 
waiting period and to provide other 
clarifications. In particular, the 

Agencies proposed that if a lender 
requires a borrower to have flood 
insurance in place at the time of loan 
origination, a borrower should obtain a 
provisional rating based on the 
construction designs and intended use 
of the building to enable the placement 
of coverage prior to receipt of the 
Elevation Certificate (EC), based on 
FEMA guidance. The proposed Q&A 
further stated that in accordance with 
the NFIP requirement, it is expected that 
an EC will be secured and a full-risk 
rating completed within 60 days of the 
policy effective date. Under the 
proposed Q&A, failure to obtain the EC 
could result in reduced coverage limits 
at the time of loss. If the lender allows 
the borrower to defer the purchase of 
flood insurance, the lender should have 
adequate controls in place to ensure the 
borrower obtains flood insurance no 
later than 30 days prior to disbursement 
of funds to the borrower in light of the 
NFIP 30-day waiting period 
requirement, instead of no later than 
when the foundation slab has been 
poured and/or an EC has been issued as 
under existing Q&A 22. 

One commenter asked the Agencies to 

clarify at exactly what point in time 
insurance is required if the lender 
chooses to defer the purchase of flood 
insurance, or whether the timing of this 
purchase is in the lender’s discretion. 
This commenter also stated that the 
proposed answer contradicts itself by 
stating that, in order to comply with the 
Regulation, the lender must require the 
borrower to have flood insurance for the 
security property in place before the 
lender disburses funds to pay for 
building construction, such as 
foundations, walls and roofs. Another 
commenter suggested that the Agencies 
clarify the phrase ‘‘as necessary’’ in the 
statement in the proposed answer 
regarding exceptions to fund 
disbursement. The Agencies note that 
under both the existing and the 
proposed answer, a lender has the 
option to defer the requirement to 
purchase flood insurance until either 
one of the following events occur: a 
foundation slab has been poured and/or 
an elevation certificate has been issued, 
or if the building to be constructed will 
have its lowest floor below the Base 
Flood Elevation, when the building is 
walled and roofed. Further, the answer 
provides that pouring the slab or 
performing preliminary site work, such 
as laying utilities, clearing brush, or the 
purchase and/or delivery of building 
materials is exempted from the 
requirement to have flood insurance in 
place before the disbursement of funds. 
To address the commenter’s concern

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

regarding the phrase ‘‘as necessary,’’ the 
Agencies are replacing this phrase with 
‘‘for funds to be used’’ in the final Q&A. 
The Agencies also are revising the 
answer to specifically reference the 
NFIP 30-day waiting period to provide 
further explanation and are making 
minor wording changes for clarity. 

With the changes described above, the 

Agencies are adopting Q&A 
Construction 4. 

Construction 5. The Agencies 

proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
23 as Q&A Construction 5. This Q&A 
addresses the application of FEMA’s 30- 
day waiting period when deferring the 
purchase of the flood insurance policy 
in connection with a construction loan. 
The Agencies proposed to revise this 
Q&A to reflect the NFIP’s change in 
policy regarding the 30-day waiting 
period. Specifically, the proposed 
answer indicated that the 30-day 
waiting period will apply if a lender 
allows a borrower to delay the purchase 
of flood insurance in connection with a 
construction loan. One commenter 
suggested that language should be 
added to allow lenders to rely on agent 
representations regarding the 
application of a waiting period, 
referencing the NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual. The Agencies note that the 
NFIP Flood Insurance Manual permits 
insurers to rely on an insurance agent’s 
representation that there is no waiting 
period in connection with the insured’s 
application for flood insurance on or 
before the closing date of the loan 
transaction. Therefore, reliance on an 
agent’s representation would not apply 
in the context of a construction loan 
where the lender allows the borrower to 
defer the purchase of flood insurance 
after the closing date. Accordingly, the 
Agencies believe that permitting agent 
reliance in this Q&A is not appropriate 
and are not adding language to the Q&A 
to address this comment. 

The Agencies also proposed to state in 

the answer that under the NFIP, a 30- 
day waiting period applies anytime a 
lender requires flood insurance not in 
connection with the making, increasing, 
renewing or extending of a designated 
loan. After further review, the Agencies 
have decided to amend this statement so 
that it more clearly answers the question 
being asked, specifically, the 
application of the NFIP waiting period 
when the purchase of the flood 
insurance policy is delayed. The final 
answer states that a 30-day waiting 
period will apply if a lender allows a 
borrower to delay the purchase of flood 
insurance in connection with a 
construction loan after making, 
increasing, renewing or extending the 
loan. Further, as noted in the NFIP 

Flood Insurance Manual, the answer 
states that a borrower must apply for 
flood insurance on or before the closing 
date of a loan transaction for the NFIP 
30-day waiting period to be waived. 
With these changes, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Construction 5. 

Construction 6. The Agencies 

proposed new Q&A Construction 6 to 
explain when a lender must begin 
escrowing flood insurance premiums 
and fees if the borrower defers the 
purchase of flood insurance in 
connection with a construction loan. 
Specifically, this Q&A provides that if a 
lender allows a borrower to defer the 
purchase of flood insurance until either 
the foundation slab has been poured 
and/or an EC has been issued, or if the 
building to be constructed will have its 
lowest floor below Base Flood Elevation 
when the building is walled and roofed, 
the lender will need to begin escrowing 
flood insurance premiums and fees at 
the time of purchase of the flood 
insurance, unless one of the escrow 
exceptions applies. The Agencies 
received one comment requesting that 
the Agencies clarify that the question 
only applies to designated loans that do 
not otherwise qualify for an exception to 
the mandatory escrow requirement. The 
Agencies do not believe that further 
elaboration is necessary because the 
answer as proposed references the 
escrow exceptions. Accordingly, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A 
Construction 6 as proposed with minor 
non-substantive clarifications. 

Section XII. Flood Insurance 
Requirements for Residential 
Condominiums and Co-Ops (Condo and 
Co-Op) 

The Agencies proposed moving 

existing section VI to the new section X 
and expanding the heading to section X 
to include other multi-family dwellings 
such as cooperatives. Proposed section 
X included existing Q&As 26 through 
33, redesignated as proposed Q&As 
Condo and Co-Op 1 through 8, 
respectively and also one new Q&A. The 
Agencies proposed changes to the Q&As 
in this section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. Because the 
Agencies are combining the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one document, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Condo 
and Co-Op section as Section XII in the 
2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers. 

Condo and Co-Op 1. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
26 as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 1, with 
minor revisions to provide greater 
clarity and accurate references with no 

intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A discusses whether 
residential condominiums, including 
multi-story condominium complexes, 
are subject to the statutory and 
regulatory requirements for flood 
insurance. The Agencies received no 
specific comment on Q&A Condo and 
Co-Op 1 and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Condo and Co-Op 2. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
27, which describes an NFIP Residential 
Condominium Building Association 
Policy (RCBAP), as Q&A Condo and Co- 
Op 2 with no changes. The Agencies 
received no specific comment on Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 2 and are adopting it 
as proposed. 

Condo and Co-Op 3. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
28 as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 3, with 
minor revisions to provide greater 
clarity and accurate references with no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A addresses the 
amount of flood insurance coverage that 
a lender must require with respect to 
residential condominium units, 
including those located in multi-story 
condominium complexes, to comply 
with the mandatory purchase 
requirements under the Act and 
Regulation. The Agencies received no 
specific comment on Q&A Condo and 
Co-Op 3 and are adopting it as proposed 
with minor non-substantive edits. 

Condo and Co-Op 4. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
29, which discusses the action a lender 
must take if there is no RCBAP 
coverage, as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 4. 
The Agencies proposed minor revisions 
to provide greater clarity and accurate 
references, with no intended change in 
substance or meaning. Two commenters 
addressed this Q&A. The first 
commenter requested that the Agencies 
address commercial condominiums and 
clarify that there is no mandatory 
purchase requirement for loans secured 
by individual commercial condominium 
units since the NFIP does not provide 
coverage for such units other than 
contents coverage. The Agencies agree 
with this commenter and are adding a 
new Q&A, Condo and Co-Op 9 that 
addresses the flood insurance 
requirements for loans secured by non- 
residential condominium units, 
described below. 

The second commenter recommended 

that the Agencies clearly state that the 
mandatory purchase requirement only 
applies to non-residential condominium 
unit owners where the loan is also 
secured by condominium contents since

disagree with this commenter. Flood 
insurance on condominium contents is 
only required when the loan is secured 
by a building in an SFHA in which 
flood insurance is available under the 
Act and the loan also takes a security 
interest in the contents. As indicated 
above, the NFIP does not provide 
coverage for non-residential 
condominium units located in either a 
residential or non-residential 
condominium building. Therefore, the 
mandatory purchase requirement does 
not apply. 

However, in reviewing this Q&A, and 
in light of new Condo and Co-Op 9, the 
Agencies believe that rewording the 
question would provide additional 
clarity. Therefore, the Agencies are 
revising the question in the final Q&A 
to ask what action must a lender take for 
an individual residential unit owner in 
a residential condominium building 
with no RCBAP coverage. The Agencies 
also are replacing the term ‘‘individual 
unit owner/borrower’’ with ‘‘individual 
unit owner,’’ for clarity. The Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Condo and Co-Op 4 
as revised. 

Condo and Co-Op 5. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate Q&A 30 as Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 5 with minor 
revisions to provide greater clarity and 
accurate references, with no intended 
change in substance or meaning. This 
Q&A discusses the action a lender must 
take if the RCBAP coverage is 
insufficient to meet the Regulation’s 
mandatory purchase requirements for a 
loan secured by an individual 
residential condominium unit. The 
Agencies received one comment on this 
Q&A. The commenter expressed 
concern with the part of the answer that 
encourages lenders to apprise borrowers 
of an additional risk of loss that may 
arise when the unit owner purchases a 
separate policy because the RCBAP 
coverage is insufficient. The commenter 
believes this adds a new expectation 
that is not required by the Act or 
Regulation. The commenter also stated 
that lenders are not in the best position, 
nor do they have the level of insurance 
knowledge, to communicate the risk of 
loss to the borrower and therefore 
suggested the Agencies remove this 
expectation from the Q&A. The 
Agencies disagree with this commenter. 
The Agencies are only encouraging 
lenders to provide this information, not 
requiring that they do so. The Agencies 
therefore are adopting this Q&A as 
proposed with minor non-substantive 
edits. 

Condo and Co-Op 6. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
31 as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 6 with 
minor revisions to provide greater 

clarity and no intended change in 
substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses what a lender must do when 
a loan secured by a residential 
condominium unit is in a complex 
whose condominium association allows 
its existing RCBAP to lapse. The 
Agencies received no specific comment 
on proposed Q&A Condo and Co-Op 6 
and are adopting it as proposed with 
minor non-substantive edits. 

Condo and Co-Op 7. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
32 as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 7 with 
minor revisions to provide greater 
clarity and no intended change in 
substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses how the RCBAP’s co- 
insurance penalty applies in the case of 
residential condominiums, including 
those located in multi-story 
condominium complexes. The Agencies 
received no specific comment on Condo 
and Co-Op 7 and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Condo and Co-Op 8. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
33 as Q&A Condo and Co-Op 8 with 
minor revisions to provide greater 
clarity and no intended change in 
substance or meaning. This Q&A 
addresses the major factors that are 
involved with coverage limitations of 
the individual unit owner’s dwelling 
policy with respect to the condominium 
association’s RCBAP coverage. The 
Agencies received no specific comment 
on proposed Q&A Condo and Co-Op 8 
and are adopting it as proposed. 

New Condo and Co-Op 9. In response 
to public comment, as described above, 
the Agencies are adopting new Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 9 to clarify the flood 
insurance requirements for non- 
residential condominium units as well 
as residential condominium units 
located in a non-residential 
condominium building. The answer 
provides that coverage is not available 
under the NFIP for an individual 
residential condominium unit or a non- 
residential condominium unit located in 
a non-residential condominium 
building. The answer further provides 
that NFIP coverage also is not available 
for a non-residential condominium unit 
located in a residential condominium 
building. Therefore, a loan secured by 
one of these types of units is not a 
designated loan under the Regulation, 
and the mandatory flood insurance 
requirement does not apply. 

Condo and Co-Op 10 (Proposed 
Condo and Co-Op 9). The Agencies 
proposed a new Q&A, designated as 
Q&A Condo and Co-Op 9 in the 
proposal, to address flood insurance 
requirements for loans secured by a unit 
in a cooperative building located in an 

SFHA. The proposed answer provided 
that a loan to a cooperative unit owner 
is not a designated loan subject to the 
Act or Regulation because the unit 
owner does not own a title to the 
building but simply the right to occupy 
a particular unit based on the 
cooperative ownership structure. One 
commenter asked the Agencies to clarify 
that since loans to cooperative unit 
owners secured by the owner’s share in 
the cooperative are not designated 
loans, lenders do not need to verify 
building-level coverage. The Agencies 
agree that lenders do not need to verify 
coverage on a cooperative building 
when a loan is secured by a share in a 
cooperative because this is not a 
designated loan subject to the Act or 
Regulation. However, the Agencies do 
not believe it is necessary to include 
this in the answer. The Agencies 
therefore are adopting this Q&A as 
proposed but renumbered as Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 10 in the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers and 
with a minor non-substantive change. 

Section XIII. Flood Insurance 
Requirements for Home Equity Loans, 
Lines of Credit, Subordinate Liens, and 
Other Security Interests in Collateral 
(Contents) Located in an SFHA (Other 
Security Interests) 

The Agencies proposed to amend the 

heading to this section for clarity. The 
Agencies also proposed to redesignate 
existing section VII, which addresses 
Flood Insurance Requirements for Home 
Equity Loans, Lines of Credit, 
Subordinate Liens, and Other Security 
Interests in Collateral, as section XI. 
This proposed section included current 
Q&As 34, 35 and 36–43, which were 
redesignated as Q&As Other Security 
Interests 1, Other Security Interests 2, 
and Other Security Interests 4 through 
9 and 11 through 12, respectively. The 
Agencies also proposed to amend the 
heading to this section for clarity. The 
Agencies proposed changes to the Q&As 
in this section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. Because the 
Agencies are combining the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and 
the March 2021 Proposed Questions and 
Answers into one document, the 
Agencies are renumbering this Other 
Security Interests section as Section XIII 
in the 2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers. 

Other Security Interests 1. The 
Agencies proposed to redesignate 
existing Q&A 34 as Q&A Other Security 
Interests 1 with no substantive changes. 
This Q&A addresses whether a home 
equity loan is considered a designated 
loan that requires flood insurance. The 
Agencies received one supportive

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

comment for this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 2. The 
Agencies proposed to redesignate 
existing Q&A 35 as Q&A Other Security 
Interests 2, with no substantive changes. 
This Q&A addresses if a draw against an 
approved line of credit secured by a 
building or mobile home, which is 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act, 
requires a flood determination under the 
Regulation. The Agencies received one 
supportive comment for this Q&A and 
are adopting it as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 3. The 
Agencies proposed new Q&A Other 
Security Interests 3, which addresses 
flood insurance coverage requirements 
for a line of credit secured by improved 
real property located in an SFHA. The 
proposed answer provided alternative 
approaches depending on when the 
lender requires flood insurance to be in 
place. The Agencies received two 
specific comments for this proposed 
Q&A. 

One commenter raised concerns about 

the language in the Q&A that indicated 
a lender may ‘‘actively review’’ its 
records ‘‘throughout the year’’ to 
determine if the appropriate amount of 
insurance is in place, and strongly 
recommended the Agencies define these 
terms for clarity. The commenter stated 
that while this review provides the 
lender flexibility, it could result in a 
different coverage requirement 
(assuming the loan balance is the lesser 
of the three components) and could 
result in force placement several times 
throughout the life of the loan. This 
commenter also stated that the Agencies 
should remove the Q&A’s language 
about informing the borrower of 
insurance risks because it is a new 
expectation from the Agencies and 
because monitoring for insurance risks 
is not the lender’s area of specialty. If 
such notice expectation is retained, the 
commenter requested more detail 
regarding the timing and content of such 
notice. 

The Agencies emphasize that the 
answer lists alternative approaches. 
Lenders may choose the option that 
works best for them and are not 
obligated to choose the second option 
where the lender actively reviews its 
records throughout the year. The 
Agencies anticipate that most lenders 
will choose the first option and believe 
that the answer provides enough 
guidance as proposed. 

Another commenter recommended 
that the Agencies clarify that the active 
review applies only to the amount of 
coverage and does not trigger a new 
determination. The commenter 

explained that there are continuing 
concerns regarding the burdens the 
Regulation places on junior lienholders 
to obtain information and concessions 
from senior lienholders regarding flood 
insurance. The Agencies believe that the 
proposed answer clearly provides that 
the review is about the amount of 
coverage and is not a triggering event 
requiring a new determination. 
Therefore, the Agencies have decided 
not to make any changes in response to 
these comments and are adopting Q&A 
Other Security Interests 3 as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 4. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
36 as Q&A Other Security Interests 4, 
with only minor changes and no 
intended change in substance or 
meaning. This Q&A considers how 
much flood insurance is required when 
a lender makes, increases, extends or 
renews a second mortgage secured by a 
building or mobile home located in an 
SFHA. 

The Agencies received two specific 

comments for proposed Q&A Other 
Security Interests 4. One commenter 
recommended that the Agencies 
reconsider their approach to this 
question. The commenter believed that 
the Q&A continues to create practical 
challenges for the flood insurance 
operating model. For instance, the 
commenter explained that flood 
insurance administrators handling the 
junior lien are also required to monitor 
senior liens and corresponding coverage 
shortcomings to establish the proper 
amount of necessary coverage, even 
though the senior lien entity may not 
have a contractual relationship with the 
junior lien administrator. The 
commenter also explained that junior 
lien flood insurance administrators and/ 
or insurers direct claim payments to 
their insured policyholders, not senior 
lienholders with which they have no 
contractual arrangement. Therefore, the 
commenter recommended an approach 
that requires each lienholder (and any 
servicer or administrator) to assure 
sufficient flood insurance coverage for 
their respective exposure in their lien 
position. 

The Agencies acknowledge that 

although following the guidance in Q&A 
Other Security Interests 4 may be 
difficult for the junior lienholder, the 
junior lienholder is responsible for 
making sure the collateral is covered by 
the proper amount of flood insurance. 
As previously stated in the preamble to 
the 2009 Interagency Questions and 
Answers, the Agencies believe that, 
given the provisions of an NFIP policy, 
a lender cannot comply with Federal 
flood insurance requirements when it 
makes, increases, extends, or renews a 

loan by requiring the borrower to obtain 
NFIP flood insurance solely in the 
amount of the outstanding principal 
balance of the lender’s junior lien 
without regard to the flood insurance 
coverage on any liens senior to that of 
the lender.40 A junior lienholder’s 
failure to take such a step can leave that 
lienholder partially or even fully 
unprotected by the borrower’s NFIP 
policy in the event of a flood loss.41 As 
such, the Agencies decline to include 
this commenter’s suggested changes. 
Another commenter stated that this 
proposed Q&A addresses the amount of 
coverage required when a lender makes, 
increases, extends, or renews a second 
mortgage. This commenter also stated 
that junior lienholders are not subject to 
the escrow requirements in the 
Regulation, and that the Agencies 
should not create such requirements 
through the Interagency Questions and 
Answers. As noted below in the 
discussion related to proposed Q&A 
Escrow 6, junior lienholders are 
generally not subject to the escrow 
requirements. The junior lienholder 
qualifies for the escrow requirement 
exception if there is adequate flood 
insurance coverage with respect to the 
loan issued by the primary lienholder.42 
However, this Q&A Other Security 
Interests 4 explains the responsibilities 
of the junior lienholder when there is a 
triggering event under the Regulation. 
This Q&A does not create new 
requirements for junior lienholders, as 
explained above to the other 
commenter. Therefore, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Other Security Interests 4 
as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 5. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
37 as Q&A Other Security Interests 5, 
with no substantive changes. This Q&A 
discusses whether a lender has to make 
a new determination or adjust insurance 
coverage if a borrower requesting a loan 
secured by a junior lien provides 
evidence that flood insurance coverage 
is in place. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this Q&A and are 
adopting it as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 6. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
38 as Q&A Other Security Interests 6, 
with no substantive changes. This Q&A 
addresses whether flood insurance is 
required if the loan request is to finance 
inventory stored in a building located 
within an SFHA, but the building is not 
security for the loan. The Agencies

received no specific comments on this 
Q&A and are adopting it as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 7. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
39 as Q&A Other Security Interests 7. 
This Q&A considers if flood insurance 
is required if a building and its contents 
both secure a loan, and the building is 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available. The Agencies 
proposed to revise the Q&A to clarify 
the application of Federal flood 
insurance requirements when both a 
building and its contents secure a loan. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comments on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed. 

Other Security Interests 8. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
40 as Q&A Other Security Interests 8, 
with no substantive changes. This Q&A 
provides that flood insurance is not 
required on contents securing a loan 
when the contents are stored in a 
building that does not also secure the 
loan. One commenter asked for 
clarification, stating that proposed Q&A 
Other Security Interests 10 appears to 
contradict proposed Q&A Other 
Security Interests 8 and may cause some 
confusion on how to handle contents 
located in a building in an SFHA. Q&A 
Other Security Interests 10 provides that 
flood insurance is required if the lender 
takes a security interest in contents 
located in a building in an SFHA 
securing the loan regardless of whether 
that security interest is perfected. The 
Agencies believe that the answers in 
both Q&As clearly provide that the 
building must secure the loan in order 
for flood insurance to be required for the 
contents located in that building. In 
addition, the Agencies do not think the 
Q&As are contradictory but provide 
complementary guidance. As such, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A Other 
Security Interests 8 as proposed, with 
minor non-substantive edits. 

Other Security Interests 9. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
41 as Q&A Other Security Interests 9. 
This Q&A discusses whether the 
Regulation applies when the lender 
takes a security interest in a building or 
mobile home and contents located in an 
SFHA only as an ‘‘abundance of 
caution.’’ The Agencies proposed to 
clarify the impact of including language 
regarding contents taken as security for 
a loan in the loan agreement. One 
commenter stated that it would be 
helpful if the Q&A provided further 
clarification with regard to the 
documentation that determines whether 
contents are taken as security for the 
loan. The commenter asked the 
Agencies to include language stating 
that the loan agreement, not the 

Uniform Commercial Code-1 or Deed of 
Trust, determines whether the contents 
are taken as security for the loan. The 
Agencies note that the answer already 
states that the language in the loan 
agreement is determinative and decline 
to include references to other 
documents. 

In connection with the proposed 
applicability Q&As, one commenter 
requested a change more relevant to 
Other Security Interests 9. Specifically, 
this commenter asked the Agencies to 
address situations where a lender 
obtains a security interest in contents 
when there is a cross collateralization 
clause or in an abundance of caution, 
specifically in situations in which the 
lender may not realize that a cross 
collateralization clause is in an old deed 
of trust, such as when the loan has been 
acquired from another bank as a result 
of a merger or if the security agreement 
is within the deed of trust instead of in 
a stand-alone document. The 
commenter recommended that contents 
coverage not be required under these 
situations. This commenter also asked 
the Agencies to exempt from the 
coverage requirements contents of 
limited value that might be included in 
a deed of trust out of an abundance of 
caution, and asked for additional 
clarification on this scenario. The 
Agencies note that under the Act and 
the Regulation, if a lender takes a 
security interest in a building and its 
contents located in an SFHA in which 
flood insurance is available under the 
Act, then flood insurance coverage is 
required for both the building and the 
contents.43 Therefore, the Agencies 
cannot exempt the building and its 
contents from required coverage even if 
the lender takes a security interest in the 
contents out of an abundance of caution. 
Lenders should review loan agreements 
and security instruments to verify that 
if they include language that takes a 
security interest in building and 
contents, flood insurance is purchased 
to cover the building and contents. If the 
lender does not secure a loan with 
building and contents, the loan 
agreement or security instrument should 
not include language to this effect, and 
language regarding taking contents as 
collateral should not be included out of 
an ‘‘abundance of caution.’’ The 
Agencies decline to make amendments 
to proposed Q&A Other Security 
Interests 9 based on this comment. 

Therefore, the Agencies are adopting 

Q&A Other Security Interests 9 as 

43 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b); 12 CFR 22.3(a); 12 CFR 
208.25(c)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 
CFR 614.4930(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) 
(NCUA). 

proposed with clarifying amendments. 
To be more inclusive, the Agencies have 
added references to security instruments 
when discussing loan agreements and 
added references to improved real estate 
when discussing contents. 

Other Security Interests 10. The 
Agencies proposed new Q&A Other 
Security Interests 10, which addresses 
whether flood insurance is required if 
the lender takes a security interest in 
contents located in a building in an 
SFHA securing the loan but does not 
perfect the security interest. As noted in 
the preamble discussion of Q&A Other 
Security Interests 8, above, the Agencies 
received one comment on this Q&A 
indicating that Q&As Other Security 
Interests 8 and 10 are in conflict. As 
previously stated, the Agencies do not 
think the two Q&As are contradictory 
and are adopting Q&A Other Security 
Interests 10 as proposed with one 
clarifying amendment. To be more 
inclusive, the Agencies have added a 
reference to a security instrument when 
discussing the loan agreement. 

Other Security Interests 11. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
42 as Q&A Other Security Interests 11, 
with no substantive changes. This Q&A 
addresses whether a note on a single- 
family dwelling offered by a borrower as 
collateral for a loan is a designated loan 
that requires flood insurance if the 
lender does not take a security interest 
in the dwelling itself. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on this 
Q&A and are adopting it as proposed. 
Other Security Interests 12. The 

Agencies proposed to redesignate Q&A 
43 as Q&A Other Security Interests 12, 
with no substantive changes. This Q&A 
discusses whether a loan that is not 
secured by real estate, but is made on 
the condition of a personal guarantee by 
a third party who gives the lender a 
security interest in improved real estate 
owned by the third party that is located 
in an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available would be considered a 
designated loan requiring flood 
insurance. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this Q&A and are 
adopting Q&A Other Security Interests 
12 as proposed. 

Section XIV. Requirement To Escrow 
Flood Insurance Premiums and Fees— 
General (Escrow) 

HFIAA significantly revised the 

escrow requirements for flood insurance 
premiums by introducing new escrow 
requirements not dependent on whether 
other insurance or taxes are escrowed, 
lender and loan-related exceptions to 
the escrow requirements, and an escrow 
notice. Accordingly, the Agencies 
proposed in the July 2020 Proposed

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Questions and Answers a number of 
new escrow-related Q&As and revisions 
to the existing escrow-related Q&As. 
Further, the Agencies proposed to 
reorganize these Q&As into three 
separate sections addressing escrow 
considerations. Specifically, proposed 
section XII included Q&As covering the 
general escrow requirements for flood 
insurance premiums and fees. Proposed 
section XIII included Q&As related to 
the small lender exception to flood 
insurance escrow requirements. 
Proposed section XIV included Q&As 
related to loan-related exceptions to the 
requirement to escrow flood insurance 
premiums and fees. These three sets of 
Q&As on the escrow of flood insurance 
premiums and fees respond to a request 
for more guidance related to the escrow 
requirement, as documented in the 
EGRPRA report. 

Proposed section XII included 

existing Q&As 51 and 52 and five new 
proposed Q&As pertaining to 
requirements to escrow flood insurance 
premiums and fees. In addition, the 
Agencies removed current Q&As 53 and 
54 because they are no longer 
applicable. 

Because the Agencies are combining 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers and the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers into one 
document, the Agencies are 
renumbering these Escrow-related 
sections as Sections XIV, XV, and XVI 
in the 2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers. 

Escrow 1. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate Q&A 52 as Q&A Escrow 1. 
This Q&A addresses the general 
question of when a lender or servicer 
must establish an escrow account for 
flood insurance premiums and fees. The 
Agencies proposed to significantly 
revise the current Q&A to explain that 
the new escrow requirement applies 
only upon a triggering event that occurs 
on or after January 1, 2016 and would 
not apply if either the small lender 
exception or any of the loan-related 
exceptions apply. The proposed answer 
also addressed a lender’s escrow 
obligations if the lender no longer 
qualifies for the small lender exception. 
The Agencies received one comment on 
this Q&A. The commenter requested 
that the Agencies expand the answer to 
explain that, if there is contractual 
authority to escrow and it is otherwise 
permitted by law, the lender may 
escrow flood premiums for safety and 
soundness reasons, even if the lender is 
not required to escrow under the Act 
and Regulation. The Agencies agree 
with the commenter that lenders could 
consider taking additional steps to 
ensure safety and soundness. However, 

the Agencies do not believe it is 
necessary to include this information in 
the answer as it is not relevant to the 
question asked in this Q&A. The 
Agencies are adopting this Q&A as 
proposed. 

Escrow 2. The Agencies proposed new 

Q&A Escrow 2 to clarify that a lender 
must escrow flood insurance premium 
payments even if it does not escrow for 
taxes or homeowner’s insurance, and is 
not required by the Regulation to escrow 
for taxes or homeowner’s insurance if it 
does escrow for flood insurance. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this proposed Q&A and are adopting 
Q&A Escrow 2 as proposed with minor 
non-substantive edits. 

Escrow 3. The Agencies proposed new 

Q&A Escrow 3 to clarify that a lender 
must escrow force-placed flood 
insurance premium payments because 
there is no exception for force-placed 
insurance under the Act or Regulation. 
The Agencies received several 
comments on this Q&A. The 
commenters suggested the Agencies 
revise the answer to clarify that, if a 
lender is not eligible for the small 
servicer exemption, the RESPA 
requirements still apply.44 Specifically, 
the commenter noted that under 
Regulation X, which implements 
RESPA,45 the servicer must pay the 
borrower disbursements in a timely 
manner and the lender is required to 
continue to advance the funds from the 
escrow to pay the flood policy premium 
if the loan is current, even if the 
customer is not paying their escrow 
payments. As a result, the commenter 
noted that there would be no need to 
force place a flood insurance policy for 
a loan that has an escrow account as the 
premium for the borrower’s policy 
would be paid. Another commenter 
noted that lenders that qualify for the 
small creditor exemption, in general, 
use provisions in a legal agreement or 
security document that allows the 
lender to make a protective advance to 
pay for insurance premiums to protect 
their collateral interest and therefore no 
escrow account would be required. The 
Agencies disagree with the commenters 
by noting that RESPA does not apply to 
flood insurance required under the 
Act.46 Further, under the Act and 
Regulation, the lender must escrow 
force-placed flood insurance premiums 
and fees because there is no exception 
for force-placed insurance. Finally, 
another commenter suggested that the 
force placement of flood insurance is 
not a triggering event that would trigger 

44 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. 
45 12 CFR 1024.17(k)(1). 
46 12 CFR 1024.37(a)(2)(i). 

escrow requirements. The Agencies 
have addressed this comment in 
proposed Q&A Applicability 13 above 
and Q&A Force Placement 10 discussed 
below. The commenter further 
recommended that the Agencies clarify 
that when a property is mapped in an 
SFHA, such event is not a triggering 
event that would trigger the escrow 
requirements. The Agencies note that 
proposed Q&A Applicability 13 and 
Q&A Escrow 4 address this issue. The 
Agencies therefore are adopting this 
Q&A as proposed. 

Escrow 4. The Agencies proposed new 
Q&A Escrow 4 to address whether flood 
insurance premium payments must be 
escrowed when a loan has not 
experienced a triggering event but it has 
experienced a non-triggering event, such 
as a loan modification, a FEMA 
remapping, or the assumption of the 
loan by a new borrower. The Agencies 
explained in the proposed answer that, 
subject to certain exceptions, until a 
loan experiences a triggering event, the 
lender is not required to escrow flood 
insurance premiums and fees unless: (i) 
A borrower requests the escrow in 
connection with the requirement that 
the lender provide an option to escrow 
for outstanding loans; or (ii) the lender 
determines that a loan exception to the 
escrow requirement no longer applies. 
The Agencies received one comment on 
this Q&A. The commenter stated that 
the Q&A is confusing as the question 
includes references to the loan being 
remapped into an SFHA but does not 
specify that remapping and assumptions 
of the loan by a new borrower are 
merely examples of non-triggering 
events. The commenter further noted 
that the answer does not address 
assumptions or remapping. The 
Agencies agree with the commenter that 
providing examples of non-triggering 
events in the question may lead to 
confusion. Therefore, the Agencies are 
revising the question in the final Q&A 
by removing the examples of non- 
triggering events. 

Escrow 5. The Agencies proposed to 
redesignate Q&A 51 as Q&A Escrow 5. 
The Agencies also proposed to revise 
this Q&A to clarify that multi-family 
buildings or mixed-use properties are 
included in the definition of 
‘‘residential improved real estate’’ and, 
therefore, are subject to the escrow 
requirement unless an exception 
applies. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this proposed 
Q&A and are adopting Q&A Escrow 5 as 
proposed, with a minor non-substantive 
edit. 

Escrow 6. The Agencies proposed new 

Q&A Escrow 6 to address the situation 
in which a junior lienholder determines

that the primary lienholder does not 
have sufficient flood insurance coverage 
in place and is also not escrowing for 
flood insurance. The proposed answer 
clarified that if the primary lienholder 
has not obtained adequate flood 
insurance, the junior lienholder would 
need to ensure adequate flood insurance 
is in place and also would need to 
escrow for that flood insurance 
premium. The proposed answer also 
indicated that the escrow requirements 
would not apply to a junior lien that is 
a home equity line of credit (HELOC), 
since HELOCs have a separate escrow 
exception under the Act and Regulation. 
The Agencies received two comments 
on this Q&A. The commenters noted 
that the answer assumes the junior 
lienholder is notified regarding any 
lapse in coverage, despite the primary 
lienholder having no obligation to 
inform the junior lienholder of a lapse 
in coverage. Further, the commenters 
noted that junior lienholders are not 
given notice if or when the first lien is 
paid off or in the event of failure to 
escrow. The commenters also noted that 
there is no specific requirement in the 
Act or Regulation that requires junior 
lienholders to escrow. Therefore, the 
commenters conclude that the Agencies 
should not imply an expectation to 
escrow in the Q&A. The Agencies 
disagree with the commenters. The 
junior lienholder qualifies for the 
escrow requirement exception if there is 
adequate flood insurance coverage with 
respect to the loan issued by the 
primary lienholder.47 Therefore, to 
qualify for the exception not to escrow, 
the junior lienholder would need to 
ensure that the borrower has obtained 
an insurance coverage amount that 
meets the mandatory purchase 
requirement. The Agencies therefore are 
adopting this Q&A as proposed. 

Escrow 7. The Agencies proposed new 

Q&A Escrow 7 to address whether a 
lender or its servicer must escrow when 
real property securing the loan is not 
located in an SFHA, but the borrower 
chooses to buy flood insurance. The 
proposed answer clarified that a lender 
or its servicer is not required to escrow 
premium payments in this situation but 
may choose to do so. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on this 
proposed Q&A and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

47 12 CFR 22.5(a)(2)(ii) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(e)(1)(ii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR 339.5(a)(2) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4935(a)(2) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.5(a)(2) (NCUA). 

Section XV. Requirement To Escrow 
Flood Insurance Premiums and Fees— 
Small Lender Exception (Escrow Small 
Lender Exception) 

Proposed new section XIII included 

seven new Q&As related to the small 
lender exception to the requirement to 
escrow flood insurance premiums. The 
Agencies proposed the Q&As in this 
section in the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers. As indicated 
above, the Agencies are renumbering 
this section as Section XV in the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 

Several commenters suggested that as 

this section consists of Q&As that are 
fundamentally escrow-related, the 
Agencies should combine them with the 
Escrow Q&As. One of these commenters 
said that this change would also reduce 
confusion with the Exemptions section 
of the Q&As. The Agencies decline to 
make this change because the Agencies 
believe that more specific topic 
categories make it easier for users to 
find relevant guidance. To clarify that 
this topic relates to escrows, however, 
the Agencies are changing the heading 
of this section from ‘‘Small Lender 
Exception’’ to ‘‘Escrow Small Lender 
Exception.’’ This change also affects the 
name of each individual Q&A. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 1. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
specify that the $1 billion threshold for 
the small lender exception is based on 
assets held at the regulated financial 
institution level and not at the holding 
company level. The Agencies received 
no specific comments on this Q&A and 
are adopting it as proposed. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 2. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
address whether a qualifying lender 
must escrow flood insurance premiums 
if it was previously required to escrow 
only under the Higher-Priced Mortgage 
Loan (HPML) rules 48 or under specific 
Federal housing programs prior to July 
6, 2012. The proposed answer clarified 
that the applicability of the first 
criterion of the small lender exception 
is dependent on whether the Federal or 
State law requirement to escrow was for 
the entire term of the loan. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting it as 

48 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, an HPML loan 

is one where the Annual Percentage Rate exceeds 
certain specified thresholds with the result that 
certain consumer protections must be observed, 
such as the escrow of property taxes and insurance 
premiums. See section 129D of the Truth in 
Lending Act as amended by section 1461(a) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, 15 U.S.C. 1639D. See also HPML 
escrow rules at 12 CFR 226.35(b)(3) (Board) and 12 
CFR 1026.35(b) (Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection). 

proposed, with minor formatting 
changes. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 3. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
address whether a lender is disqualified 
from the exemption if it escrowed funds 
on behalf of a third party. The Agencies’ 
proposed answer drew a distinction 
based on whether the lender established 
an individual escrow account for the 
loan. Specifically, the proposed answer 
provided that if a lender collected 
escrow funds at closing and maintained 
servicing of the loan, the lender would 
not qualify for the small lender 
exception because the lender would 
have had a policy of consistently and 
uniformly requiring the deposit of funds 
in an escrow account by establishing 
escrow accounts that the lender would 
service. The proposed answer further 
provided that if the lender collected the 
escrow funds at closing at the behest of 
a third party and then transferred those 
funds to the third party servicing that 
loan, the lender would qualify for the 
small lender exception under the 
answer, provided the lender did not 
establish an individual escrow account 
and the lender transferred the escrow 
funds to the third party as soon as 
reasonably practicable. 

A commenter asked the Agencies to 
clarify what constitutes ‘‘establishing an 
individual escrow account.’’ The 
commenter asserted that for lenders 
subject to the escrow requirements, 
RESPA requires the lender to create and 
provide an initial escrow statement and 
to collect the initial escrow deposit. The 
originating lender then holds this 
deposit until the loan is sold. If the sale 
of the loan is delayed and the first 
payment is received by the original 
lender, the lender also must hold this 
payment. The commenter asked the 
Agencies to provide direction on how 
these funds should be held so as not to 
constitute ‘‘establishing an individual 
escrow account.’’ In response, the 
Agencies state that determining what 
constitutes an individual escrow 
account is beyond the scope of these 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 

A commenter asked the Agencies to 
clarify or provide examples of the term 
‘‘as soon as reasonably practicable.’’ By 
this term, the Agencies mean that there 
were no unreasonable delays 
considering the facts and circumstances 
of the situation. Whether the lender 
transferred the funds to the third party 
‘‘as soon as reasonably practicable’’ is 
not a bright-line determination, and the 
Agencies believe there is no meaningful 
way to provide further clarification or 
examples. 

The Agencies are adopting this new 

Q&A as proposed.

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 4. 
The Agency proposed this new Q&A to 
address whether a lender is eligible for 
the escrow small lender exception if it 
escrows only upon a borrower’s request. 
The proposed answer reiterated the 
explanation in the preamble to the 2015 
Final Rule that a lender maintaining 
escrow accounts only on a borrower’s 
request does not constitute a consistent 
or uniform policy of requiring escrow 
and therefore a lender could be eligible 
for the small lender exception if the 
other requirements are met. The 
proposed answer also explained that the 
small lender exception does not apply 
if, on or before July 6, 2012, the lender 
had a policy of consistently and 
uniformly requiring the deposit of taxes, 
insurance premiums, fees, or any other 
charges in an escrow account for a loan 
secured by residential improved real 
estate or a mobile home. 

The Agencies believe that the 

proposed question and the first sentence 
of the proposed answer, as described 
above, are confusing because they are 
written in the present tense, even 
though under the Regulation a lender’s 
current escrow policy—whether it is to 
escrow upon a borrower’ request or 
whether it is to consistently and 
uniformly require escrow—is not 
relevant to whether the small lender 
escrow exception applies to the lender. 
Rather, only a lender’s escrow policy on 
or before July 6, 2012, is relevant. 

Accordingly, in the final Q&A, the 
Agencies are revising the question to ask 
if a lender is eligible for the small lender 
exception if, on or before July 6, 2012, 
it offered escrow accounts only upon a 
borrower’s request. The Agencies are 
revising the first sentence of the answer 
to state that if, on or before July 6, 2012, 
a lender offered escrow accounts only 
upon the request of borrowers, that 
practice did not constitute a consistent 
or uniform policy of requiring escrow 
and the lender is eligible for the 
exception, provided all other conditions 
for the exception are met. The Agencies 
are retaining the second sentence of the 
answer as proposed. That sentence 
reiterates the Regulation, which 
provides that the small lender exception 
does not apply if, on or before July 6, 
2012, the lender had a policy of 
consistently and uniformly requiring the 
deposit of taxes, insurance premiums, 
fees, or any other charges in an escrow 
account for a loan secured by residential 
improved real estate or a mobile home. 
A commenter stated that while the 

Q&A provided helpful guidance, 
additional clarity regarding whether a 
policy ‘‘consistently and uniformly 
require[s]’’ the establishment of an 
escrow account would be helpful. The 

commenter asked for additional 
information to aid lenders in better 
understanding the intent of this 
language and suggested that the 
Agencies provide examples of policies 
that do and do not satisfy this provision. 
Consistent with the Regulation, the 

revisions to the Q&A clarify that a 
lender’s escrow policy after July 6, 2012, 
is not relevant to whether the escrow 
small lender exception applies. In 
addition, the final Q&A clearly states 
that a lender’s policy, on or before July 
6, 2012, of offering escrow accounts 
only upon the request of borrowers did 
not constitute a ‘‘consistent or uniform’’ 
policy of requiring escrow. In specific 
response to the commenter, for policies 
other than those in which a lender 
offered escrow accounts only upon the 
request of borrowers before July 6, 2012, 
the Agencies believe that whether a 
policy consistently and uniformly 
required escrow accounts is not a bright- 
line determination, and the Agencies do 
not believe they can provide meaningful 
examples. The Agencies are adopting 
this new Q&A with the revisions 
discussed above. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 5. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
address whether the option to escrow 
notice is required for: (1) All 
outstanding loans not excepted from the 
escrow requirement and secured by 
residential real estate; and (2) 
outstanding loans not secured by 
buildings located in an SHFA. The 
proposed answer clarified that the 
option to escrow notice requirement 
only applies to lenders who have a 
change in status and no longer qualify 
for the small lender exception. Such 
lenders are required to provide the 
option to escrow notice by September 
30 of the first calendar year in which the 
lender has had a change in status for all 
outstanding designated loans secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home as of July 1 of the first 
calendar year in which the lender no 
longer qualifies for the small lender 
exception. The proposed answer also 
clarified that the option to escrow notice 
requirement does not apply to loans or 
lenders that are excepted by the 
Regulation from the escrow 
requirement, nor does it apply to loans 
not subject to the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 6. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
explain that a lender must send to a 
borrower a notice of the option to 
escrow flood insurance premium 
payments when the borrower has 

previously waived escrow for flood 
insurance because it is possible the 
borrower’s circumstances have changed 
and, if offered another chance to escrow, 
the borrower may desire to do so. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this new Q&A and are adopting it as 
proposed. 

Escrow Small Lender Exception 7. 

The Agencies proposed this new Q&A to 
clarify that lenders who qualify for the 
small lender exception are not required 
to provide borrowers with either the 
escrow notice or the option to escrow 
notice. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on this new Q&A 
and are adopting it as proposed. 

Section XVI. Requirement To Escrow 
Flood Insurance Premiums and Fees— 
Escrow Loan Exceptions (Escrow Loan 
Exceptions) 

Proposed new section XIV included 
existing Q&As 55 and 56 and three new 
Q&As, all regarding the loan-related 
exceptions to the escrow requirement. 
The Agencies proposed changes to the 
Q&As in this section in the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers. The 
Agencies are changing the proposed 
heading of this section from ‘‘Loan 
Exceptions’’ to ‘‘Escrow Loan 
Exceptions’’ to provide further clarity. 
Further, in response to a comment on 
proposed Q&As Escrow Loan 
Exceptions 1 and 5, discussed below, 
the Agencies are reordering the 
questions from general to specific, so 
that proposed Escrow Loan Exceptions 
Q&As 4 and 5 become Q&As Escrow 
Loan Exceptions Q&As 3 and 2, 
respectively, with the remaining Q&As 
renumbered accordingly. This 
reordering provides a more logical flow 
of the Escrow Loan Exception questions. 
As indicated above, the Agencies are 
renumbering this section as Section XVI 
in the 2022 Interagency Questions and 
Answers. 

Escrow Loan Exceptions 1. The 
Agencies proposed to redesignate 
existing Q&A 55 as proposed Q&A Loan 
Exceptions 1. The Agencies revised this 
Q&A to address whether escrow 
accounts must be set up for commercial 
loans secured by residential buildings 
based on the new loan-related 
exceptions. Specifically, the proposed 
answer clarified that extensions of 
credit primarily for business, 
commercial, or agricultural purposes are 
not subject to the escrow requirement 
even if such loans are secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home. The Agencies received a 
few comments on this Q&A. One 
commenter stated that this Q&A is 
helpful and appropriate. Another 
commenter noted that this proposed

32859 

Q&A mirrors proposed Escrow Loan 
Exceptions 5 and suggested that the 
Agencies reorder the questions so that 
the two Q&As would appear in close 
sequence. As indicated above, the 
Agencies agree and are moving 
proposed Q&A Loan Exceptions 5 so 
that it directly follows Q&A Escrow 
Loan Exceptions 1. Further, the 
Agencies also are removing references to 
‘‘multi-family’’ properties in Q&A 
Escrow Loan Exceptions 1 as the Q&A 
can apply to more than the ‘‘multi- 
family’’ context. Another commenter 
suggested providing the definition of 
‘‘residential property’’ or clarify that 
lenders may rely on assertions from the 
borrower or insurance agent regarding 
the property’s intended use. As noted in 
Q&A Exemptions 1, a structure that is 
part of a residential property is a 
structure used primarily for personal, 
family, or household purposes, and not 
used primarily for agricultural, 
commercial, industrial, or other 
business purposes. The Agencies are 
adding a cross reference to Q&A 
Exemptions 1 in this Q&A to address 
this comment. With these changes, the 
Agencies are adopting Q&A Escrow 
Loan Exceptions 1. 

Escrow Loan Exceptions 2 (Proposed 

Loan Exceptions 5). The Agencies 
proposed a new Q&A, designated as 
Q&A Loan Exceptions 5 in the proposal, 
to discuss whether there is an exception 
to the escrow requirement for loans 
secured by multi-family buildings. The 
Agencies clarified in the proposed 
answer that escrow requirements do not 
apply to a loan that is an extension of 
credit primarily for business, 
commercial, or agricultural purposes, 
even if the loan is secured by residential 
real estate such as a multi-family 
building, nor would it apply to a loan 
secured by a particular unit in a multi- 
family residential building if a 
condominium association, cooperative, 
homeowners association, or other 
applicable group provides an adequate 
policy and pays for the insurance as a 
common expense. Otherwise, under the 
proposed answer, the escrow 
requirements generally apply to loans 
for units in multi-family residential 
buildings. 

As discussed above, and at the request 

of a commenter, the Agencies are re- 
numbering proposed Q&A Loan 
Exceptions 5 as Q&A Escrow Loan 
Exceptions 2 to ensure logical flow and 
clarity. The Agencies also are clarifying 
the question in this Q&A to ask whether 
escrow accounts for flood insurance 
premiums and fees are required for 
loans secured by particular units located 
in multi-family buildings by focusing 
this Q&A on escrow requirement for 

only loans secured by particular units 
located in multi-family buildings and 
removing the reference to the exception 
for commercial loans in the question. 
Q&A Escrow Loan Exceptions 1 would 
cover commercial loans secured by 
residential buildings. The Agencies are 
also adding a cross reference to Escrow 
Loan Exceptions 1 for reader reference. 
With these revisions, the Agencies are 
adopting renumbered Q&A Escrow Loan 
Exceptions 2. 

Escrow Loan Exceptions 3 (Proposed 

Loan Exceptions 4). The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
56 as proposed Q&A Loan Exceptions 4 
in the proposal. The Agencies proposed 
to revise this Q&A to address an escrow 
account for insured real property 
covered by an RCBAP. The proposed 
answer noted that while escrow is not 
required for property covered by an 
RCBAP, if the RCBAP coverage is 
inadequate and the borrower obtains a 
separate dwelling policy, escrow would 
be required for such a policy unless an 
escrow exception applies. The Agencies 
received positive comment on this Q&A 
and are adopting it as proposed, but 
renumbering as Q&A Escrow Loan 
Exceptions 3. 

Escrow Loan Exceptions 4 (Proposed 

Loan Exceptions 2). The Agencies 
proposed a new Q&A, designated as 
Q&A Loan Exceptions 2 in the proposal, 
to clarify that construction-permanent 
loans that have a construction phase 
before the loan converts into permanent 
financing do not qualify for the 12- 
month exception from escrow even if 
one phase of the loan is for 12 months 
or less. The Agencies received positive 
comment on this Q&A and are adopting 
it as proposed, but renumbered as Q&A 
Escrow Loan Exceptions 4. 

Escrow Loan Exceptions 5 (Proposed 

Loan Exceptions 3). The Agencies 
proposed a new Q&A, designated as 
Q&A Loan Exceptions 3 in the proposal, 
to clarify that a subordinate lienholder 
must begin to escrow as soon as 
reasonably practicable after it becomes 
aware that it has moved into the 
primary lien position on a designated 
loan subject to the escrow requirement. 
The Agencies received one specific 
comment on this proposed Q&A. This 
commenter stated that this Q&A 
provides important clarification 
regarding escrow obligations and loan 
documentation regarding the payoff of a 
senior lien. The Agencies are adopting 
this Q&A as proposed, but renumbered 
as Q&A Escrow Loan Exceptions 5. 

Section XVII. Force Placement of Flood 
Insurance (Force Placement) 

The Agencies proposed to move 
current section X, which includes 

current Q&As 57 through 62, to 
proposed section XV, and add 10 new 
Q&As. The Agencies proposed changes 
to the Q&As in this section in the July 
2020 Proposed Questions and Answers. 
As discussed in the preamble to the July 
2020 Proposed Questions and Answers, 
this set of Q&As would respond to a 
request for more guidance related to 
force placement of flood insurance from 
commenters through the EGRPRA 
process.49 Commenters were 
appreciative of the Agencies including 
Q&As on force placement and generally 
found these Q&As to be helpful. 
Because the Agencies are combining the 
July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers and the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers into one 
document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Force Placement 
section as Section XVII in the 2022 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 
Force Placement 1. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate current Q&A 
57, re-proposed in 2011 but not 
finalized, as proposed Q&A Force 
Placement 1. This proposed Q&A 
discussed the requirements that must be 
fulfilled before force placement can 
occur, as well as the notice 
requirements a lender must follow prior 
to force-placing flood insurance. One 
commenter agreed with the Agencies’ 
statement in the answer that neither the 
Act nor the Regulation require lenders 
to monitor flood insurance over the life 
of the loan. The commenter, however, 
stated its belief that a lender’s safety and 
soundness is not protected by the lender 
monitoring for flood insurance but by 
contracting with lender-placed 
insurance providers to ensure that flood 
insurance is automatically and 
continuously provided on all collateral 
in the lender’s portfolio upon any lapse 
or insufficiency in flood insurance 
coverage procured by the borrower. 
Consequently, the commenter 
recommended that the Agencies add 
language discussing the safety and 
soundness benefits of lender-placed 
insurance for lenders and the benefit 
provided to borrowers in the Q&As. The 
Agencies decline to add the suggested 
language as the Agencies believe this 
statement is outside the scope of the 
force-placed flood insurance 
requirement in the Regulation. 

Another commenter noted that the 
proposed answer states that the lender 
may provide the amount of flood 
insurance needed in the force placement 
notice and that if the lender or servicer

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

is aware that the borrower has obtained 
insurance that otherwise satisfies the 
flood insurance requirements but in an 
insufficient amount, the lender or 
servicer should inform the borrower that 
an additional amount of insurance is 
needed to comply with the Regulation. 
Because the amount of the insurance is 
not required to be included in the force 
placement notice, the commenter 
requested that the Agencies remove 
from the answer all references to 
including the amount in the force 
placement notice. However, the 
Agencies note that the answer does not 
require inclusion of this information. 
The Agencies continue to believe this 
information may be helpful to borrowers 
to the extent a lender chooses to include 
it in the force placement notice. 
Therefore, the Agencies are continuing 
to include this recommendation in the 
final Q&A Force Placement 1. 

A few commenters suggested that the 
Agencies amend the last sentence of the 
proposed answer, which provided that 
if the lender or servicer is aware that a 
borrower has obtained insurance that 
otherwise satisfies the flood insurance 
requirements but in an insufficient 
amount, the lender or servicer should 
inform the borrower an additional 
amount of insurance is needed in order 
to comply with the Regulation before 
force-placing flood insurance. 
Specifically, these commenters 
expressed concern about the use of the 
phrase ‘‘is aware’’ and suggested the 
Agencies use ‘‘determines’’ instead. The 
Agencies disagree and believe that the 
use of the word ‘‘determines’’ would 
suggest that there is a new force 
placement determination necessitating a 
new force placement notice, and as 
discussed in detail below in connection 
with Q&A Force Placement 6, 
potentially could be interpreted as 
allowing lenders to ‘‘restart’’ the clock 
that would extend the time period 
beyond the 45 days permitted under the 
Regulation in which the lender or its 
servicer must force place flood 
insurance. Thus, the Agencies’ use of a 
term other than ‘‘determines’’ is 
deliberate, and the Agencies are not 
modifying the language as suggested. 

For the reasons discussed above, the 

Agencies are adopting Q&A Force 
Placement 1 as proposed. 

Force Placement 2. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 2 
to clarify when a lender must provide a 
force placement notice to a borrower. 
The proposed answer provided that the 
Regulation requires the lender, or its 
servicer, to send the borrower the force 
placement notice upon making a 
determination that the building or 
mobile home and any personal property 

securing the designated loan is not 
covered by flood insurance or is covered 
by flood insurance in an amount less 
than the amount required under the 
Regulation. The proposed answer also 
stated that if there is a brief delay in 
providing the notice, the Agencies 
would expect the lender or servicer to 
provide a reasonable explanation for the 
delay and provided as an example for 
the delay the lender using batch 
processing to send the force placement 
notice to its borrowers. Several 
commenters requested that the Agencies 
amend the language from ‘‘brief delay’’ 
to ‘‘reasonable delay.’’ The Agencies 
disagree with these commenters and are 
retaining ‘‘brief delay’’ to emphasize to 
lenders that the delay should not be 
long. Another commenter also suggested 
that the Agencies provide additional 
examples of explanations for delays in 
providing the force placement notice 
other than batch processing of force 
placement notices. In response to this 
commenter, the Agencies are amending 
the proposed answer to include manual 
exception processing as another 
example. The Agencies are adopting 
Q&A Force Placement 2 with this 
change. 

Force Placement 3. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
58 as proposed Q&A Force Placement 3 
without any change. Proposed Q&A 
Force Placement 3 discussed whether a 
servicer could force place flood 
insurance on behalf of a lender. The 
Agencies did not receive any specific 
comment on Q&A Force Placement 3, 
and are adopting it as proposed. 

Force Placement 4. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 4, 
which discussed whether a lender can 
satisfy its notice requirement by sending 
the force placement notice to the 
borrower prior to the expiration of the 
flood insurance policy. Proposed Q&A 
Force Placement 4 was based on 
proposed Q&A 60 from 2011, which the 
Agencies did not finalize. The Agencies 
received one specific comment on this 
proposed Q&A, agreeing that the 
Agencies’ wording reflects the intent of 
the Act and Regulation that lenders 
ensure that notice be provided upon 
determining that the flood insurance 
policy has actually lapsed or is 
insufficient. Therefore, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Force Placement 4 as 
proposed. 

Force Placement 5. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
61 as proposed Q&A Force Placement 5 
with minor revisions for clarity and no 
change in meaning or substance. This 
Q&A addresses when a lender must 
have flood insurance in place if the 
borrower has not obtained adequate 

insurance within 45 days of notification. 
A commenter recommended that the 
answer be updated to reflect 
information on the effective date of 
coverage, the timing for placing 
coverage, and the process for placing 
coverage. Given that lenders’ particular 
processes may differ in force-placing 
flood insurance, the Agencies believe 
that amending the answer to include 
details on these additional steps would 
be confusing and that it is unnecessary 
to discuss how the lender complies with 
the Regulation. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Force Placement 5 as 
proposed. 

Force Placement 6. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 6 
to clarify that, once a lender makes a 
determination that a designated loan has 
no or insufficient flood insurance 
coverage, the lender must notify the 
borrower and, if the borrower fails to 
obtain sufficient flood insurance 
coverage within 45 days after the 
original notice, the lender must 
purchase coverage on the borrower’s 
behalf and may not extend the period 
for obtaining force-placed coverage by 
sending another force placement notice 
during that time. Some commenters 
suggested that the Agencies reconsider 
the answer to permit subsequent 
determinations within the force 
placement process. As discussed above 
in connection with Q&A Force 
Placement 1, however, the Agencies do 
not believe that the answer should be 
amended to essentially permit lenders 
to extend the time to force place beyond 
the 45 days allowed by the Act and the 
Regulation, which would put both the 
borrower and the lender at greater risk 
of the property not being covered by 
sufficient flood insurance for longer 
periods of time. Therefore, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Force Placement 6 as 
proposed. 

Force Placement 7. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 7, 
which addressed when a force-placed 
policy should begin to provide coverage 
after an existing policy expires. The 
proposed answer also gave an example 
of the timing for the new policy. A few 
commenters stated that the Agencies’ 
proposed example was not consistent 
with how policies expire and become 
effective in practice and that the answer 
needs to specifically include the time of 
day that the existing policy expires and 
the new policy becomes effective. One 
of these commenters noted that an 
expiring policy expires and a newly 
effective policy generally takes effect at 
12:01 a.m. on the same date. As 
recommended by these commenters, the 
Agencies are revising the answer in 
Q&A Force Placement 7 to include an

example that provides if a policy 
expires at 12:01 a.m. on a certain day, 
the new policy should be effective as of 
12:01 a.m. of the same day. 

Force Placement 8. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
59 as proposed Q&A Force Placement 8. 
In the July 2020 Proposed Questions 
and Answers, the Agencies significantly 
revised this Q&A to discuss more fully 
the minimum amount of flood insurance 
coverage that is statutorily required and 
to illustrate this point through a 
hypothetical example. The proposed 
answer stated that if the outstanding 
principal balance is the basis for the 
minimum amount of required flood 
insurance, the lender must ensure that 
the force-placed policy amount covers 
the existing loan balance plus any 
additional force-placed premiums and 
fees that will be added to the loan 
balance. 

Several commenters recommended 
that the Agencies revise proposed Q&A 
Force Placement 8, as well as Q&A 
Force Placement 10, to consistently use 
the term ‘‘outstanding principal 
balance,’’ which is the term used in the 
Regulation to determine the amount of 
minimum flood insurance coverage 
required. The proposed answer used 
‘‘outstanding principal balance’’ 
interchangeably with ‘‘loan balance.’’ 
Similarly, commenters stated that the 
Agencies should amend the answer to 
use the term ‘‘capitalized’’ rather than 
‘‘added.’’ These commenters stated that, 
consistent with accounting standards, 
fees, secured advances, interest and 
other amounts authorized by a loan 
agreement are treated distinctly from the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
loan unless they are capitalized into the 
outstanding principal balance. As a 
result, these commenters contended that 
fees that have not been capitalized into 
the outstanding principal balance 
should not be taken into account when 
determining the minimum amount of 
required flood insurance. 

The Agencies agree with these 

commenters and are revising Q&A Force 
Placement 8 as suggested to consistently 
use the term ‘‘outstanding principal 
balance’’ and provide that if the 
outstanding principal balance is used as 
the basis for determining the minimum 
amount of required flood insurance, 
then the lender should take into account 
any premiums and fees that have been 
capitalized into the outstanding 
principal balance in determining the 
required minimum amount. For 
consistency, the Agencies also are 
making these changes in terminology in 
Q&A Force Placement 10, as discussed 
below. With the changes discussed 
above, the Agencies are adopting Q&A 

Force Placement 8, with a minor non- 
substantive change. 

Force Placement 9. The Agencies 
proposed to redesignate existing Q&A 
62 as proposed Q&A Force Placement 9. 
This Q&A addresses when a lender or 
its servicer may charge the borrower for 
the cost of force-placed flood insurance. 
The proposed answer clarified that a 
lender or servicer may charge a 
borrower for the cost of force-placed 
flood insurance beginning on the date of 
lapse or insufficient coverage, and 
would not need to wait 45 days after 
providing notification to force place 
insurance. As the Agencies stated in the 
preamble to the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers, lenders that 
monitor loans secured by property 
located in an SFHA for continuous 
coverage of flood insurance help ensure 
that they complete the force placement 
of flood insurance in a timely manner 
and minimize any gaps in coverage and 
any charge to the borrower for coverage 
for a timeframe prior to the lender’s or 
its servicer’s date of discovery and force 
placement. The proposed answer further 
explained that if a lender or its servicer, 
despite its monitoring efforts, discovers 
a loan with no or insufficient coverage, 
it may charge for the cost of premiums 
and fees incurred by the lender or 
servicer in purchasing the flood 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf, 
including premiums and fees incurred 
for coverage beginning on the date of 
lapse or insufficient coverage, if the 
lender has purchased a policy on the 
borrower’s behalf and that policy was 
effective as of the date of the insufficient 
coverage. 

Several commenters suggested that 
the Agencies include an example with 
specific dates in the answer to Q&A 
Force Placement 9 to illustrate when it 
may be appropriate for a lender to 
‘‘backdate’’ a force-placed flood 
insurance policy and charge the 
borrower. However, the Agencies note 
that evaluating such actions by a lender 
depends on the specific facts and 
circumstances. As a result, the Agencies 
believe that including a particular 
example in the answer that would not 
be broadly applicable would not 
provide helpful guidance. 

Although the Regulation states that a 

lender may charge a borrower for the 
cost of force-placed insurance beginning 
on the date of lapse or insufficient 
coverage, the Agencies note that 
significant ‘‘backdating’’ of flood 
insurance policies could indicate that 
there are weaknesses with the lender’s 
compliance management system. 
Therefore, rather than providing an 
example, which would be of limited 
utility, the Agencies are adding 

language stating that a lender’s or 
servicer’s frequent need to purchase 
policies on a borrower’s behalf having 
coverage that precedes the date of 
purchase may, depending upon the facts 
and circumstances, indicate that there 
are weaknesses within the lender’s or 
servicer’s compliance management 
system. The Agencies believe that the 
addition of this language to Q&A Force 
Placement 9 would provide guidance on 
the Agencies’ supervision of such 
practices and would be more helpful 
than a specific example. 

Some commenters suggested that the 
Agencies amend the last sentence of the 
proposed answer, which stated that 
when a lender or its servicer purchases 
a policy on the borrower’s behalf, the 
lender or its servicer may not charge for 
premiums and fees for coverage 
beginning on the date of lapse or 
insufficient coverage if that policy 
purchased on the borrower’s behalf did 
not provide coverage for the borrower 
prior to purchase. These commenters 
noted that a policy may provide 
coverage effective to a date that 
precedes the date purchased. The 
Agencies decline to make this change. If 
there is no coverage for the borrower 
prior to purchase of the policy, such as 
coverage that may be provided under a 
dual interest master policy, then it 
would be inappropriate for a lender to 
charge a borrower for coverage the 
borrower did not have. 

With the addition discussed above, 
the Agencies are adopting Q&A Force 
Placement 9. 

Force Placement 10. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 10 
to discuss various methods of charging 
a borrower for the amount of force- 
placed flood insurance policy premiums 
and fees and when such methods would 
constitute an ‘‘increase’’ that would 
trigger the applicability of certain flood 
insurance regulatory requirements. 
Proposed Q&A Force Placement 10 
described three options that the 
Agencies understand lenders may use to 
charge a borrower for force-placed flood 
insurance: adding the premium and fees 
to the ‘‘mortgage loan balance;’’ adding 
premiums and fees to an unsecured 
account; or billing the premium and fees 
directly to the borrower. 

As discussed above with respect to 

Q&A Force Placement 8, several 
commenters requested that the Agencies 
consistently use the term ‘‘outstanding 
loan balance’’ and to distinguish 
between instances when fees from force- 
placed flood insurance are ‘‘capitalized’’ 
into the outstanding loan balance and 
when they are not. For the reasons 
discussed in connection with Q&A 
Force Placement 8, the Agencies are

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

revising Q&A Force Placement 10 to 
incorporate these changes in 
terminology. The Agencies also are 
revising the discussion of the second 
method to refer more generally to 
adding premiums and fees to an 
account, rather than an ‘‘unsecured’’ 
account, as the Agencies understand 
that amounts advanced to cover 
premiums and fees that have not been 
capitalized into the outstanding 
principal balance may still be secured 
by the property. 

One of these commenters also noted 
that lenders may advance funds to cover 
force-placed flood insurance premiums 
and fees through an advance of the 
borrower’s escrow account. The 
commenter further stated that such a 
method also would not cause an 
increase in the outstanding principal 
balance, and as a result, should not be 
considered an ‘‘increase’’ that would 
trigger the applicability of certain flood 
insurance regulatory requirements. The 
Agencies agree and are including this 
method as another example in Q&A 
Force Placement 10. With the changes 
discussed above, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Force Placement 10. 

Force Placement 11. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 11, 
which addressed the sufficiency of 
evidence of flood insurance in 
connection with refunding premiums 
paid by a borrower for force-placed 
insurance during any period of overlap 
with borrower-purchased insurance. 
The proposed answer provided that, as 
stated in the Regulation, a lender is 
required to refund premiums paid by a 
borrower for force-placed flood 
insurance during any period of overlap 
with borrower-purchased flood 
insurance. The proposed answer stated 
that in that scenario, a lender must 
accept a policy declarations page that 
includes the existing flood insurance 
policy number and the identity of, and 
contact information for, the insurance 
company or its agent and that the 
Regulation does not require that the 
declarations page include any 
additional information. The proposed 
answer also discussed documentation 
with respect to situations not involving 
a lender’s refund of premiums for force- 
placed insurance. 

Several commenters requested 
guidance on whether and how Q&A 
Force Placement 11 applies to reviewing 
flood insurance policies issued by 
private insurers to determine whether 
they meet the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation. In 
response, the Agencies are clarifying 
that the answer in Q&A Force Placement 
11 relates to ascertaining the sufficiency 
of the policy to meet the mandatory 

flood insurance purchase requirement to 
determine whether a refund is required. 
In addition, the Agencies are including 
a cross-reference to Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 5 for guidance relating to 
evaluating whether the policy meets the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation. 

Another commenter suggested that 

the Agencies require that the 
declarations page also include the 
coverage amount, deductible, and term 
of the policy. However, as noted, for the 
refund provision of the force placement 
requirement, the Act and the Regulation 
state that for purposes of confirming a 
borrower’s existing flood insurance 
coverage, a lender or its servicer shall 
accept from the borrower an insurance 
policy declarations page that includes 
the existing flood insurance policy 
number and the identity of, and contact 
information for, the insurance company 
or its agent. Therefore, the Agencies 
cannot mandate that the declarations 
page include any additional 
information. 

Force Placement 12. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 12 
to address whether a lender is required 
to refund any premiums to the borrower 
if the lender cannot obtain a refund 
from the insurance company because 
the borrower did not provide proof of 
coverage in a timely manner or the 
insurance company fails to provide the 
lender the refund within 30 days. The 
proposed answer clarified that the 
lender must refund any premiums and 
fees paid by the borrower for force- 
placed insurance that overlaps with a 
borrower-purchased flood insurance 
policy within 30 days of receipt of a 
confirmation of a borrower’s existing 
flood insurance coverage. The lender 
must provide this refund to the 
borrower within the specified time 
period under the Regulation without 
exception, even when the lender has not 
yet received a refund from the insurance 
provider of the force-placed flood 
insurance policy. One commenter 
agreed with the proposed answer but 
thought the question proposed by the 
Agencies for Q&A Force Placement 12 
was confusing and suggested that the 
Agencies reword the question. The 
Agencies agree with the commenter and 
are revising the question in Q&A Force 
Placement 12 to be similar to the 
language suggested by the commenter. 
Thus, the question, as adopted, asks if 
a lender receives confirmation of a 
borrower’s existing flood insurance 
coverage evidencing an overlap in 
coverage with a force-placed flood 
insurance policy, but the lender does 
not receive a refund from the insurance 
provider of the force-placed flood 

insurance policy in a timely manner, is 
the lender still obligated to refund any 
premiums for overlapping coverage to 
the borrower within 30 days. The 
Agencies are adopting Q&A Force 
Placement 12 with the change to the 
question discussed above. 

Force Placement 13. The Agencies 
proposed new proposed Q&A Force 
Placement 13 to explain that a lender 
can rely on a force-placed flood 
insurance policy to satisfy the 
mandatory purchase requirement for a 
refinance or loan modification if the 
borrower does not purchase his or her 
own policy. The proposed answer also 
suggested that lenders could encourage 
the borrower to purchase his or her own 
policy, likely at a reduced cost, prior to 
the loan closing. One commenter 
specifically agreed with the Agencies’ 
proposed answer to the question. 
Another commenter suggested that the 
Agencies amend the answer to clearly 
note that the lender’s encouragement of 
the borrower to purchase his or her own 
policy is at the lender’s discretion. The 
Agencies are amending the answer in 
Q&A Force Placement 13 to include the 
phrase ‘‘at its discretion’’ to make clear 
that this suggested encouragement is 
optional. This same commenter also 
noted that stating that a borrower- 
purchased flood insurance policy would 
‘‘likely’’ be at a reduced cost compared 
to the force-placed flood insurance 
policy may not always be true. In 
response, the Agencies are amending 
the language in Q&A Force Placement 
13 to state that a borrower-purchased 
flood insurance policy ‘‘may be 
available at a lower premium amount’’ 
to soften the language and also make it 
consistent with similar language in Q&A 
Force Placement 14. 

Another commenter suggested that 

the Agencies remove the term 
‘‘refinances’’ from the proposed answer 
because the commenter did not believe 
that a refinancing is always a triggering 
event. The Agencies do not agree with 
this commenter’s characterization of a 
refinancing. A refinancing is the 
termination of an old loan contract and 
the making of a new loan in its place; 
as a result, a refinancing is the 
‘‘making’’ of a loan and does trigger 
flood insurance requirements under the 
Regulation. The Agencies are adding 
language to the Q&A to make this 
position clear. In addition, based on this 
comment, the Agencies reexamined the 
references to loan modifications in Q&A 
Force Placement 13 and are making 
revisions to the answer to clarify that 
the loan modifications discussed in the 
answer are only those that would result 
in the increase, renewal, or extension of 
a loan; in other words, those loan

modifications that would constitute a 
triggering event under the Regulation. 
The Agencies are also adding cross 
references to Q&As Applicability 6 and 
Applicability 13. Finally, the Agencies 
are making a minor non-substantive 
change to the answer. 

Force Placement 14. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 14 
in response to an issue raised by 
EGRPRA commenters.50 Under the 
proposed answer, a lender is not 
required to send a notice prior to force- 
placing insurance at the expiration of a 
force-placed policy, but the lender or its 
servicer, at its discretion, may notify the 
borrower about its plan to renew the 
force-placed policy. Commenters to the 
July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers appreciated the flexibility and 
clarity provided in the proposed answer 
and noted that lenders typically choose 
one of two methods to notify borrowers 
of renewal of a lender-placed policy: (1) 
Renewal with a pre-expiration notice; or 
(2) renewal with a post-expiration 
notice. One of these commenters 
suggested language to expand the 
answer to explain these notice cycle 
methods. However, the Agencies note 
that the proposed answer already states 
that the lender or its servicer, at its 
discretion, may notify the borrower that 
the lender is planning to renew or has 
renewed the force-placed policy. 
Therefore, the answer already 
contemplates both notice cycle 
methods, and the Agencies are adopting 
Q&A Force Placement 14 as proposed. 
Force Placement 15. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 15 
to indicate that, although there is no 
explicit duty to monitor flood insurance 
coverage over the life of the loan in the 
Act or Regulation, for purposes of safety 
and soundness, many lenders obtain 
‘‘life-of-loan’’ monitoring. One 
commenter agreed with the Agencies’ 
statement that neither the Act nor the 
Regulation require lenders to monitor 
flood insurance over the life of the loans 
but recommended that the answer be 
combined into the answer for Q&A 
Force Placement 1. The commenter also 
stated that the term ‘‘life-of-loan’’ 
monitoring is generally associated only 
with monitoring changes in flood zone 
maps. The Agencies believe that it is 
important to distinguish the guidance 
provided in Q&A Force Placement 15 
from the general discussion on force 
placement in Q&A Force Placement 1. 
Consequently, the Agencies are keeping 
Q&A Force Placement 15 as a separate 
Q&A. However, to clarify that the ‘‘life 

50 See FFIEC Joint EGRPRA Report to Congress, 
March 2017 at 124, https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_
FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf. 

of loan’’ monitoring referenced in Q&A 
Force Placement 15 is ‘‘life of loan’’ 
monitoring related to continuous 
coverage rather than monitoring for map 
changes, the Agencies are amending the 
question to denote that the Q&A 
concerns ‘‘life of loan’’ monitoring for 
continuous coverage of designated 
loans. With this change, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Force Placement 15. 
Force Placement 16. The Agencies 
proposed new Q&A Force Placement 16 
to address what a lender or its servicer 
must do if it receives a notice indicating 
that a property will be remapped into an 
SFHA as of a future effective date. Many 
commenters stated that lenders do not 
always receive advance notice of a 
remapping and requested that the 
Agencies also provide guidance to 
lenders when they receive notice that a 
property already has been remapped. In 
response to commenters’ suggestions, 
the Agencies are expanding Q&A Force 
Placement 16 to include guidance on a 
lender’s or servicer’s responsibility 
when it receives notice after a property 
securing a designated loan has been 
remapped. In those cases, lenders 
should follow the requirements outlined 
in Q&A Force Placement 1. The adopted 
answer also adds a cross-reference to 
Q&A Force Placement 9 to address 
questions regarding when the lender or 
servicer may charge the borrower for a 
force-placed flood insurance policy. 

One commenter was confused by the 

proposed answer’s statement that the 
effective date of future remap is the date 
the lender or servicer must determine 
sufficiency of flood insurance coverage, 
but also providing that the lender or 
servicer may immediately force-place 
flood insurance as of the remapping 
effective date. The commenter stated 
that as written, the proposed answer 
seemed to suggest that two different 
effective dates are possible. To clarify, 
the Agencies’ are amending the answer 
to state that as of the effective date of 
the remapping, if the lender makes a 
determination that the property securing 
a designated loan is not covered by 
sufficient flood insurance, the lender or 
servicer must begin the force placement 
process and may charge the borrower for 
the force-placed insurance policy. 

With the changes described above, the 

Agencies are adopting Q&A Force 
Placement 16. 

Other Comments. One commenter 
stated that the Q&As on force placement 
should generally reflect a consistent 
treatment of the sequence of the force 
placement process beginning with 
determination of absent or insufficient 
coverage, then notice, and finally 
placement of flood insurance 
throughout the duration of the loan. The 

Agencies have reviewed the force 
placement Q&As generally to ensure 
that they reflect this sequence. This 
commenter also requested that the 
Agencies define what lender actions 
constitute making a ‘‘determination’’ 
that flood insurance is absent or 
inadequate and whether that 
determination is conditional. The 
Agencies do not believe it is possible to 
define all instances of when a lender 
‘‘determines’’ flood insurance is absent 
or inadequate and that determination is 
not necessarily ‘‘conditioned’’ on any 
specific actions or events. 

Another commenter urged the 

Agencies to clarify when the 
insufficiency or inadequacy of a flood 
insurance policy necessitates starting 
the force placement process, such as 
when a lender receives a new flood 
insurance policy or when a flood 
insurance policy is renewed and 
coverage is determined insufficient or 
inadequate. The Agencies decline to 
limit determination of insufficiency or 
inadequacy of a flood insurance policy 
to the instances described by the 
commenter. Under the Regulation, this 
determination can occur at any point 
during the life of the loan. 

XVIII. Flood Insurance Requirements in 
the Event of the Sale or Transfer of a 
Designated Loan and/or Its Servicing 
Rights (Servicing) 

The Agencies proposed to move 
current section VIII, which provides 
guidance on flood insurance 
requirements in the event of the sale or 
transfer of a designated loan and/or its 
servicing rights, to proposed section 
XVI, and to redesignate current Q&As 44 
through 50 as Q&As Servicing 1 through 
7, respectively. The Agencies proposed 
changes to the Q&As in this section in 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. The Agencies proposed to 
revise these questions and answers to 
account for the change in the title of the 
head of FEMA from ‘‘Director’’ to 
‘‘Administrator’’ and received no 
specific comment on that proposed 
revision, which is included in the final 
Interagency Questions and Answers. 
Because the Agencies are combining the 
July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers and the March 2021 Proposed 
Questions and Answers into one 
document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Servicing section as 
Section XVIII in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. 

One commenter recommended that 
the Agencies clarify whether all Q&As 
in this section apply to flood insurance 
policies issued by private insurers. In 
response, the Agencies are revising the 
Q&As where appropriate to clarify that

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

the requirement that a regulated lender 
must provide notice of a new servicer’s 
identity to the Administrator of FEMA 
(or the Administrator’s designee) 
applies to NFIP policies. In the case of 
a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer, the lender should 
provide notice of a new servicer’s 
identity to the flood insurance provider, 
as FEMA does not accept these notices 
for policies issued by private insurers. If 
the lender did not provide notice of a 
new servicer’s identity to the flood 
insurance provider, the provider would 
be unable to properly administer the 
policy, such as by providing notice to 
the servicer about the expiration of the 
flood insurance policy. The burden of 
such notification should be minor 
because exchanges of information 
between the lender and the insurance 
provider ordinarily occur as a matter of 
routine. Where appropriate, the final 
Servicing Q&As contain revisions that 
incorporate this clarification. These 
revisions are discussed below. 

Servicing 1. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 44 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 1. This 
proposed Q&A explained how the flood 
insurance requirements under the 
Regulation apply to lenders under two 
scenarios involving loan servicing. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on Q&A Servicing 1. However, the 
Agencies are clarifying in the final Q&A 
the applicability of the notice 
requirements to flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers, as discussed 
above. The Agencies are adopting 
Servicing 1 with this change and with 
other minor non-substantive revisions. 

Servicing 2. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 45 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 2. This 
proposed Q&A addressed the question 
of when a lender must provide notice to 
FEMA or its designee when that lender 
will be the servicer of the loan. Several 
commenters recommended that the 
Agencies clarify in the answer that the 
notice requirement does not apply 
where the flood insurance policy is 
issued by a private insurer. The 
commenter stated that there appears to 
be no reason to notify FEMA or its 
designee that the lender is the servicer 
of the loan when the property securing 
the loan is not insured by an NFIP 
policy. In the alternative, a commenter 
suggested that the Agencies could add a 
new Q&A to the Private Flood 
Compliance Q&As that provides this 
clarification. This commenter also 
asserted that the Agencies should make 
a technical change to the Regulation to 
remedy the situation. Another 
commenter also identified this concern 

but did not provide specific suggestions 
or recommendations. 

In response to these comments, the 
Agencies are clarifying the answer to 
provide that in the case of a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer, the lender should provide 
notice of a new servicer’s identity to the 
flood insurance provider. The Agencies 
also state in the revised answer that if 
the lender does not provide this notice 
to the flood insurance provider, the 
provider will be unable to properly 
administer the policy, such as by 
providing notice to the servicer about 
the expiration of the flood insurance 
policy. Revising the Regulation to 
address this point is beyond the scope 
of the Interagency Questions and 
Answers. 

One commenter interpreted the 

Regulation to indicate that the process 
of acquiring or revising a flood 
insurance policy will fulfill the initial 
notification requirement. The 
commenter noted that the Regulation 
provides no exception for the notice 
when dealing with a scenario where an 
RCBAP provides sufficient coverage 
(i.e., no additional individual flood 
insurance policy is required). The 
commenter stated that in this scenario, 
the Administrator of FEMA or the 
Administrator’s designee would not 
receive notice, since a flood insurance 
policy is not purchased or updated. The 
commenter asked for clarification of the 
Agencies’ expectation in this scenario. 
In response to this comment, the 
Agencies clarify that if a unit owner 
does not purchase or update a separate 
policy, then no notice is required. 
However, notice would be required if 
the unit owner purchases or updates a 
separate dwelling policy. The Agencies 
are not changing the Q&A in response 
to this comment. 

The Agencies are adopting this Q&A 
with the changes discussed above, along 
with minor technical, non-substantive 
changes. 

Servicing 3. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 46 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 3. This 
proposed Q&A explained that a RESPA 
Notice of Transfer sent to the 
Administrator of FEMA (or the 
Administrator’s designee, i.e., the 
insurance provider) satisfies the 
requirements of the Act. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on Q&A 
Servicing 3 and are adopting it with a 
minor non-substantive change to the 
question but otherwise as proposed. 

Servicing 4. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 47 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 4. This 
proposed Q&A explained that delivery 
of the notice can be delivered 

electronically, including by batch 
transmission. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on Q&A Servicing 4 
and are adopting it as proposed. 

Servicing 5. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 48 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 5. This 
proposed Q&A addressed the question 
of whether a lender is required to 
provide notice to the Administrator or 
the Administrator’s designee (i.e., the 
insurance provider) if a loan and its 
servicing rights are sold by the lender. 
The Agencies received no specific 
comments on Q&A Servicing 5. In the 
final Q&A, the Agencies are clarifying 
the applicability of the notice 
requirement to flood insurance policies 
issued by private insurers, as discussed 
above. With this change, the Agencies 
are adopting Q&A Servicing 5 otherwise 
as proposed. 

Servicing 6. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 49 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 6. This 
proposed Q&A addressed the question 
of whether a lender is required to 
provide notice when the servicer, not 
the lender, sells or transfers the 
servicing rights to another servicer. The 
proposed answer provided that after 
servicing rights are sold or transferred, 
the subsequent notification obligations 
applicable in connection with NFIP 
policies are the responsibility of the 
new servicer. The Agencies received no 
specific comments on Q&A Servicing 6. 
In the final Q&A, the Agencies are 
clarifying that in connection with a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer the Agencies do not 
expect the lender to provide notice to 
the private insurance provider of any 
subsequent sale or transfer of the 
servicing rights because the new 
servicer should provide this notice. 
With this change, and a minor non- 
substantive edit, the Agencies are 
adopting Q&A Servicing 6 otherwise as 
proposed. 

Servicing 7. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 50 as 
proposed Q&A Servicing 7. This 
proposed Q&A addressed the 
responsibilities of the parties for 
notifying the Administrator’s designee 
(i.e., the insurance provider) in the 
event of a merger or acquisition of one 
lender with another. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on Q&A 
Servicing 7. In the final Q&A, the 
Agencies are clarifying the applicability 
of the notice requirement to flood 
insurance policies issued by private 
insurers, as discussed above. With this 
change, the Agencies are adopting Q&A 
Servicing 7 otherwise as proposed.

Section XIX. Mandatory Civil Money 
Penalties (Penalty) 

Section XVII includes questions and 

answers related to mandatory civil 
penalties. For organizational purposes, 
the Agencies proposed to move existing 
section XVI to proposed section XVII 
and redesignated existing Q&As 81 and 
82 as proposed Q&A Penalty 1 and 2, 
respectively. The Agencies proposed 
changes to the Q&As in this section in 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers. Because the Agencies are 
combining the July 2020 Proposed 
Questions and Answers and the March 
2021 Proposed Questions and Answers 
into one document, the Agencies are 
renumbering this Penalty section as 
Section XIX in the 2022 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. 

Penalty 1. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 81 as 
proposed Penalty 1. This Q&A discusses 

which violations of the Act can result in 
a mandatory civil money penalty. The 
Agencies proposed to update this Q&A 
to reflect, as provided in the Biggert- 
Waters Act: (1) the increased maximum 
civil money penalty that the Agencies 
may impose per violation when there is 
a pattern or practice of flood violations; 
and (2) the elimination of the limit on 
the total amount of penalties that the 
Agencies may assess against a regulated 
lending institution during any calendar 
year.51 Specifically, proposed Q&A 
Penalty 1 provides that the civil money 
penalty amount cannot exceed $2,000 
per violation and that there is no ceiling 
on the total penalty amount that a 
Federal supervisory agency can assess 
for a pattern or practice of violations. 
This Q&A also notes that each Agency 
adjusts the limit pursuant to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990. For purposes of clarity and 
accuracy, the Agencies also proposed 

minor revisions with no intended 
change in substance or meaning. The 
Agencies received no specific comments 
on this Q&A and are adopting Q&A 
Penalty 1 as proposed, with the addition 
of more specific citations to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990. 

Penalty 2. The Agencies proposed to 

redesignate existing Q&A 82 as 
proposed Q&A Penalty 2 with only 
minor revisions, with no intended 
change in substance or meaning. This 
Q&A addresses what constitutes a 
‘‘pattern or practice’’ of violations for 
which civil money penalties must be 
imposed under the Act. The Agencies 
received no specific comments on this 
Q&A and are adopting it as proposed.

Interagency Questions and Answers 
Regarding Flood Insurance 

The Interagency Questions and 
Answers are organized by topic. Each 
topic addresses a major area of flood 
insurance law and regulations. For ease 
of reference, the following terms are 
used throughout this document: ‘‘Act’’ 
refers to the National Flood Insurance 
Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973, as revised. 
‘‘Regulation’’ refers to each Agency’s 
current final rule.1 ‘‘Lenders’’ refers 
only to regulated lending institutions as 
defined in the Act.2 ‘‘Designated loan’’

I. Determining the Applicability of 
Flood Insurance Requirements for 
Certain Loans (Applicability) 
APPLICABILITY 1. Does the 

Regulation apply to a loan where the 
building or mobile home securing such 
loan is located in a community that 
does not participate in the National 
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)? 
Yes, the Regulation does apply; 
however, a lender need not require 
borrowers to obtain flood insurance for 
a building or mobile home located in a 
community that does not participate in 
the NFIP, even if the building or mobile 
home securing the loan is located in an 
SFHA. Nonetheless, a lender, using the 
Standard Flood Hazard Determination 
Form, must still determine whether the 
building or mobile home is located in an 
SFHA.3 If the building or mobile home 
is determined to be located in an SFHA, 
a lender is required to mail or deliver 
a written notice to the borrower.4 In this 
case, a lender, generally, may make a 
conventional loan without requiring 
flood insurance. However, because 
Federal agencies such as the Small 
Business Administration, Veterans 
Administration, or Federal Housing 
Administration are prohibited from 
guaranteeing or insuring a loan secured 
by a building or mobile home located in 
an SFHA in a community that does not 
participate in the NFIP, a lender would 
not be able to make a federally 
guaranteed or insured loan. See 42 
U.S.C. 4106(a). Also, a lender is 
responsible for exercising sound risk 
management practices to avoid making 

a loan secured by a building or mobile 
home located in an SFHA where no 
flood insurance is available, if doing so 
would pose an unacceptable risk to the 
lender. 

APPLICABILITY 2. Some borrowers 
have buildings with limited utility or 
value and, in many cases, the borrower 
would not replace them if lost in a flood. 
Must a lender require flood insurance 
for such buildings? 

Lenders must require flood insurance 

on a building or mobile home when 
those structures are part of the property 
securing the loan and are located in an 
SFHA in a participating community.5 
However, flood insurance is not 
required on a structure that is part of a 
residential property but is detached 
from the primary residential structure of 
such property and does not serve as a 
residence.6 If the limited utility or value 
structure does not qualify for the 
detached structure exemption, a lender 
may consider ‘‘carving out’’ the building 
from the security it takes on the loan to 
avoid having to require flood insurance 
on the structure. However, the lender 
should fully analyze the risks of this 
option. In particular, a lender should 
consider whether and how it would be 
able to market and sell the property 
securing its loan in the event of 
foreclosure. See also Q&A Exemptions 
1. 

APPLICABILITY 3. What are a 
lender’s requirements under the 
Regulation for a loan secured by 
multiple buildings when some of the 
buildings are located in an SFHA in 
which flood insurance is available and 
other buildings are not? What if the 
buildings are located in different 
communities and some of the 
communities participate in the NFIP 
and others do not? 

A lender must determine whether a 

building securing the loan is in an 
SFHA.7 In cases in which the loan is 
secured by multiple buildings and some 
of the buildings are located in an SFHA

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

in which flood insurance is available 
under the Act, but other buildings are 
not located in an SFHA (or are located 
in an SFHA, but not in a participating 
community), a lender is required to 
obtain flood insurance only on the 
buildings securing the loan that are 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act.8 
For example, assume a loan is secured 
by five buildings as follows: 

• Buildings 1 and 2 are located in an 
SFHA and the community participates 
in the NFIP; 

• Building 3 is not located in an 

SFHA; and 

• Buildings 4 and 5 are located in an 

SFHA, but the communities do not 
participate in the NFIP. 

In this scenario, the lender is required 
to obtain insurance only on buildings 1 
and 2. As a matter of safety and 
soundness, however, a lender may 
decide to require the purchase of flood 
insurance (from a private insurer) on 
buildings 4 and 5 because these 
buildings are located in an SFHA. In 
addition, depending on the risk factors 
of building 3, the lender may elect to 
require flood insurance as a matter of 
safety and soundness, even if the 
building is not located in an SFHA. 

Further, if any portion of a building 
is located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act, the 
flood insurance requirement applies 
even if the entire structure is not located 
in the SFHA. However, a building 
located on a portion of a plat or lot that 
is not in an SFHA is not subject to the 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirement even if a portion of the plat 
or lot not containing a building extends 
into an SFHA.9 

APPLICABILITY 4. What is a lender’s 
responsibility if a particular building or 
mobile home that secures a loan is not 
located within an SFHA, or is no longer 
located within an SFHA due to a map 
change? 

Although a lender is not obligated to 
require mandatory flood insurance on a 
building or mobile home securing a loan 
that is not located within an SFHA or 
is no longer located within an SFHA, a 
lender may, at its discretion and taking 
into consideration State law, as 
appropriate, require flood insurance for 
property outside of SFHAs for safety 
and soundness purposes as a condition 
of a loan being made. Each lender 
should tailor its own flood insurance 
policies and procedures to suit its 

8 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

9 See 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b); FEMA Standard Flood 

Hazard Determination Form. 

business needs and protect its ongoing 
interest in the collateral. 

APPLICABILITY 5. Does a lender’s 
purchase from another lender of a loan 
secured by a building or mobile home 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act 
trigger any requirements under the 
Regulation? 

No. A lender’s purchase of a loan, 
secured by a building or mobile home 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act, 
alone, is not an event that triggers the 
Regulation’s requirements, such as 
making a new flood determination or 
requiring a borrower to purchase flood 
insurance. Requirements under the 
Regulation are triggered when a lender 
makes, increases, extends, or renews a 
designated loan.10 A lender’s purchase 
of a loan does not fall within any of 
those categories. 

However, if a lender becomes aware at 
any point during the life of a designated 
loan that flood insurance is required, 
the requirements of the Regulation 
apply, including force-placing 
insurance, if necessary.11 Depending on 
the circumstances, the lender may need 
to conduct due diligence for safety and 
soundness reasons, which could include 
determining whether flood insurance on 
purchased loans is required. 
Additionally, if the purchasing lender 
subsequently refinances, extends, 
increases, or renews a designated loan, 
it must comply with the Regulation.12 
APPLICABILITY 6. If a loan is being 

restructured or modified, does that 
constitute a triggering event under the 
Regulation? 

It depends. If a loan modification or 

restructuring involves recapitalizing 
into the loan’s outstanding principal 
balance: (1) Delinquent payments and 
other amounts due under the loan and 
the maturity date of the loan otherwise 
stays the same, or (2) amounts that were 
otherwise originally contemplated to be 
part of the loan pursuant to the contract 
with the borrower and the maturity date 
of the loan otherwise stays the same, the 
Regulation would not apply because the 
modification or restructuring would not 
increase, extend, or renew the terms of 
the loan. 

In contrast, if the loan modification or 

restructuring changes terms of the loan 

10 12 CFR 22.2(e), 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 
208.25(b)(5) and (c)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.2, 
339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925, 614.4930 (FCA); 
and 12 CFR 760.2, 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

11 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

such as by increasing the outstanding 
principal balance beyond what was 
contemplated as part of the loan under 
the contract with the borrower, or by 
extending the maturity date of the loan, 
the Regulation would apply because the 
lender increased or extended the terms 
of the loan beyond what was originally 
contemplated to be part of the loan.13 
APPLICABILITY 7. Are table funded 
loans treated as new loan originations? 
Yes. Table funding, as defined in the 
Regulation, means a settlement at which 
a loan is funded by a contemporaneous 
advance of loan funds and an 
assignment of the loan to the person 
advancing the funds.14 A loan made 
through a table funding process is 
treated as though the party advancing 
the funds has originated the loan.15 The 
funding party is required to comply 
with the Regulation. The table funding 
lender can meet the administrative 
requirements of the Regulation by 
requiring the party processing and 
underwriting the application to perform 
those functions on its behalf. 

APPLICABILITY 8. Is a lender 

required by the Act or the Regulation to 
perform a review of its, or of its 
servicer’s, existing loan portfolio for 
compliance with the flood insurance 
requirements under the Act and 
Regulation? 

No. Apart from the requirements 

mandated when a loan is made, 
increased, extended, or renewed,16 a 
lender need only review and take action 
on any part of its existing portfolio for 
safety and soundness purposes, or if it 
knows or has reason to know of the 
need for NFIP coverage.17 Regardless of 
the lack of such requirement in the Act 
and Regulation, however, sound risk 
management practices may lead a lender 
to conduct scheduled periodic reviews 
that track the need for flood insurance 
on a loan portfolio. 

APPLICABILITY 9. Do the mandatory 

purchase requirements under the Act 
and Regulation apply when a lender 
participates in a loan syndication or 
participation?

interest in a loan either by participation

or syndication after that loan has been 
made does not trigger the requirements 
of the Act or the Regulation, such as 
making a new flood determination or 
requiring a borrower to purchase flood 
insurance. Nonetheless, as with 
purchased loans, depending upon the 
circumstances, the lender may 
undertake due diligence for safety and 
soundness purposes to protect itself 
against the risk of flood or other types 
of loss. 

Lenders who pool or contribute funds 
that will be simultaneously advanced to 
a borrower or borrowers as a loan 
secured by improved real estate would 
be making a loan that triggers the 
requirements of the Act and 
Regulation.18 Federal flood insurance 
requirements also would apply when a 
group of lenders refinances, extends, 
renews or increases a loan.19 Although 
the agreement among the lenders may 
assign compliance duties to a lead 
lender or agent, and include clauses in 
which the lead lender or agent 
indemnifies participating lenders 
against flood losses, each participating 
lender remains individually responsible 
for compliance with the Act and 
Regulation. Therefore, the Agencies will 
examine whether the regulated 
institution/participating lender has 
performed upfront due diligence to 
determine whether the lead lender or 
agent has undertaken the necessary 
activities to ensure that the borrower 
obtains appropriate flood insurance and 
that the lead lender or agent has 
adequate controls to monitor the loan(s) 
on an ongoing basis for compliance with 
the flood insurance requirements. 
Further, the Agencies expect the 
participating lender to have adequate 
controls to monitor the activities of the 
lead lender or agent for compliance with 
flood insurance requirements over the 
term of the loan. This due diligence and 
monitoring is especially important 
when the lead lender itself is not subject 
to Federal flood insurance requirements. 

APPLICABILITY 10. Is a lender 
expected to consider any triggering 
event or any cashless roll of which it 
becomes aware in any tranche of a 
multi-tranche credit facility, regardless 
of whether the lender participates in the 
affected tranche? 

No. Consistent with Q&A 

Applicability 9, the Agencies expect 
that a lender participating in a multi- 
tranche credit facility will perform 
upfront due diligence to determine 

18 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

19 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

whether the lead lender has adequate 
controls to monitor the loan on an 
ongoing basis for compliance with the 
flood insurance requirements. This due 
diligence is especially important when 
the lead lender itself is not subject to 
Federal flood insurance requirements. 
Even though each lender participating 
in a tranche in a multi-tranche credit 
facility remains individually 
responsible for compliance with the 
flood insurance requirements relating to 
structures securing the tranche in which 
it participates, this obligation can be 
achieved through the upfront due 
diligence process when determining the 
lead lender/administrative agent’s 
ongoing monitoring for compliance with 
flood insurance requirements. A multi- 
tranche credit facility is analogous in 
many respects to a loan syndication or 
participation. Q&A Applicability 9 
addresses applicability of the mandatory 
purchase requirements when a lender 
participates in a loan syndication or 
participation. Similar to a loan 
syndication or participation, a multi- 
tranche credit facility involves one 
credit agreement that describes and 
governs all the tranches. In addition, 
similar to a loan syndication or 
participation, a multi-tranche credit 
facility typically has one lead lender 
that acts as the administrative agent for 
the credit facility and its tranches. Thus, 
the Agencies do not expect a lender 
participating in one tranche in a multi- 
tranche credit facility to be responsible 
for taking direct steps to comply with 
flood insurance requirements in 
connection with a triggering event (i.e., 
making, increasing, extending or 
renewing) or cashless roll that occurs in 
a tranche in which the lender does not 
participate. 

A multi-tranche commercial credit 
facility is a loan arrangement containing 
more than one type of loan or tranche. 
Each loan within the overall credit 
facility is made to the same borrower or 
group of related borrowers, but the loans 
may have different lenders and different 
terms and conditions. For example, a 
credit facility might have one tranche 
that is a revolving line of credit with a 
one-year maturity date and one or more 
additional tranches that are fixed rate 
loans with different interest rates and 
different maturity dates. Various lenders 
may participate in each tranche. 
Generally, the tranches share the same 
collateral and there is one credit 
agreement that describes and governs all 
the tranches. 

Under most multi-tranche credit 
facility agreements, a triggering event 
can occur within a particular tranche 
without any requirement to notify and 
obtain the consent of the lenders not 

participating in that tranche. Lenders 
may also participate in a cashless roll, 
which is an exchange of an existing loan 
for a new or amended loan without any 
transfer of cash. A cashless roll may be 
used to replace or supplement existing 
tranches, but not to increase the total 
amount of committed debt; therefore, 
this is not considered a triggering event. 

APPLICABILITY 11. Does an 

automatic extension of a credit facility, 
that was agreed upon by the borrower 
and the lender at loan origination and 
memorialized in the loan agreement, 
constitute a triggering event i.e., making, 
increasing, extending or renewing) that 
would trigger the Federal flood 
insurance requirements? 

No. An automatic extension of a 
credit facility that was agreed upon by 
the lender and the borrower at loan 
origination and memorialized in the 
loan agreement does not constitute a 
triggering event (i.e., making, increasing, 
extending or renewing) that would 
trigger the Federal flood insurance 
requirements, because the automatic 
extension was agreed to in the original 
loan contract. 

APPLICABILITY 12. What is the 

applicability of the mandatory purchase 
requirement during a period of time 
when coverage under the NFIP is not 
available? 

During a period when coverage under 

the NFIP is not available, such as due 
to a lapse in authorization or in 
appropriations, lenders may continue to 
make loans subject to the Regulation 
without requiring flood insurance 
coverage. However, lenders must 
continue to make flood 
determinations,20 provide timely, 
complete, and accurate notices to 
borrowers,21 and comply with other 
applicable parts of the Regulation. 

In addition, lenders should evaluate 
safety and soundness and legal risks and 
prudently manage those risks during a 
period when coverage under the NFIP is 
not available. Lenders should take 
appropriate measures or consider 
possible options in consultation with 
the borrower to mitigate loss exposures 
in the event of a flood during such 
periods. For example, 

• Lenders may determine the risk of 

loss is sufficient to justify a 
postponement in closing the loan until 
the NFIP coverage is available again. 

• Lenders may require the borrower 

to obtain private flood insurance if 
available, as a condition of closing the

loan. However, after considering the 
cost of the private flood policy, a lender 
or the borrower may decide to postpone 
closing rather than incur a long-term 
obligation to address a possible short- 
term lapse. 

• Lenders may make the loan without 
requiring the borrower to apply for flood 
insurance and pay the premium while 
NFIP coverage is unavailable. However, 
this option poses a number of risks that 
should be carefully evaluated. 
Moreover, once NFIP coverage becomes 
available again, the Agencies expect that 
flood insurance will be obtained for 
these loans, including, if necessary, by 
force placement.22 Before making such 
loans, lenders should make borrowers 
aware of the flood insurance 
requirements and that force-placed 
insurance is typically more costly than 
borrower-obtained insurance. Lenders 
also should have a process to identify 
these loans to ensure that insurance is 
promptly purchased when NFIP 
coverage becomes available subsequent 
to their closing. 

APPLICABILITY 13. What is a 

‘‘triggering event’’ under the Regulation? 
If there is a triggering event, what is 
required under the Regulation? 

Under the Regulation, a triggering 
event occurs when a designated loan is 
made, increased, extended, or renewed 
(also known as a ‘‘MIER’’ or ‘‘MIRE’’ 
event).23 If a triggering event occurs 
with respect to a designated loan, the 
lender must comply with the Regulation 
as applicable, including the mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirement, 
the requirement to provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower, 
the requirement to notify the 
Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) or the 
Administrator’s designee (the insurance 
provider) in writing of the identity of 
the servicer of the loan, and the 
requirement to escrow for a loan 
secured by residential property, unless 
either the lender or the loan qualifies for 
an exception.24 

Examples of events that are not 

considered triggering events for 
purposes of the Regulation include: The 
purchase of a loan from another lender 
(see Q&A Applicability 5); a loan 
restructuring or modification that does 
not increase the amount of the loan nor 
extend or renew the terms of the loan 

22 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

23 12 CFR 22.3(a); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) (Board); 12 
CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) (FCA); and 
12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

(see Q&A Applicability 6); the 
assumption of the loan by another 
borrower; the remapping of a building 
securing the loan into an SFHA; the 
acquisition by a lender of an interest in 
a loan either by participation or 
syndication (see Q&A Applicability 9); a 
cashless roll (see Q&A Applicability 10); 
certain automatic extensions of credit 
(see Q&A Applicability 11); And certain 
treatments of force placement premiums 
and fees (see Q&A Force Placement 10). 
APPLICABILITY 14. May a lender rely 

on an insurance policy providing 
portfolio-wide coverage to meet the 
flood insurance purchase requirement 
or the force placement requirement 
under the Regulation? 

It depends. A lender may not rely on 
an insurance policy providing portfolio- 
wide coverage to meet the flood 
insurance purchase or force placement 
requirements if the policy only provides 
coverage to the lender (‘‘single 
interest’’). When a flood insurance 
policy has expired and the borrower has 
failed to renew coverage, insurance 
policies providing portfolio-wide 
coverage may be useful protection for 
the lender for a gap in coverage in the 
period of time before a force-placed 
policy takes effect. However, even if a 
lender has portfolio-wide coverage to 
address gaps, the lender must still 
ensure the flood insurance purchase 
requirement is satisfied at the time a 
loan is made, increased, renewed or 
extended, and the lender must still force 
place coverage on the borrower’s behalf 
in a timely manner, as required,25 and 
may not rely on an insurance policy that 
provides portfolio-wide coverage as a 
substitute for a force-placed policy. 

In contrast, lenders may purchase a 

master flood insurance policy that 
provides coverage for its entire portfolio 
and covers both the lender and the 
borrower (‘‘dual interest’’). Such 
policies provide coverage for the entire 
portfolio as well as individual coverage, 
and include the issuance of an 
individual property policy or certificate 
after the required notice period. 

APPLICABILITY 15. When does 

mandatory flood insurance on a 
designated loan need to be in place 
during the closing process? 

The Regulation states that a lender 

cannot ‘‘make’’ a loan secured by a 
property in an SFHA without adequate 
flood insurance coverage being in 
place.26 A lender should use the loan 
‘‘closing date’’ to determine the date by 

which flood insurance must be in place 
for a designated loan. FEMA deems the 
‘‘closing date’’ as the day the ownership 
of the property transfers to the new 
owner based on State law. 

‘‘Wet funding’’ and ‘‘dry funding,’’ 
which varies by State, refer to when a 
mortgage is considered officially closed. 
In a ‘‘wet’’ settlement State, the signing 
of closing documents, funding, and 
transfer of title occur all on the same 
day. By contrast, in a ‘‘dry’’ settlement 
State, documents are signed on one 
date, but loan funding and/or transfer of 
title/recording occur on subsequent 
date(s). Therefore, in ‘‘dry’’ settlement 
States, the ‘‘closing date’’ is the date of 
property transfer, regardless of loan 
signing or funding date. 

For transactions where there is no 
transfer of property ownership, such as 
a refinance, and the borrower is 
purchasing a new flood insurance 
policy or is required to increase flood 
insurance coverage, the lender should 
use the loan’s consummation date as the 
effective date for the flood insurance 
policy, as noted above. 

It is also important to note that the 
application and premium payment for 
NFIP flood insurance must be provided 
at or prior to the ‘‘closing date’’ since 
this impacts the FEMA flood insurance 
effective date and any resulting 30-day 
waiting period for new policies not 
made in connection with a triggering 
event. This application requirement 
applies for properties located in both 
dry and wet settlement States. See NFIP 
Flood Insurance Manual. 

II. Exemptions From the Mandatory 
Flood Insurance Purchase 
Requirements (Exemptions) 

EXEMPTIONS 1. What are the 
exemptions from the mandatory 
purchase requirement? 

There are only three exemptions from 
the mandatory requirement to purchase 
flood insurance on a designated loan. 
The first applies to State-owned 
property covered under a policy of self- 
insurance satisfactory to the 
Administrator of FEMA.27 The second 
applies if both the original principal 
balance of the loan is $5,000 or less, and 
the original repayment term is one year 
or less.28 The third applies to any 
structure that is a part of any residential 
property but is detached from the 
primary residential structure of such 
property and does not serve as a 
residence. For purposes of the detached

32871 

structure exemption, a ‘‘structure that is 
a part of residential property’’ is a 
structure used primarily for personal, 
family, or household purposes, and not 
used primarily for agricultural, 
commercial, industrial, or other 
business purposes. In addition, a 
structure is ‘‘detached’’ from the 
primary residential structure if it is not 
joined by any structural connection to 
that structure. Furthermore, whether a 
structure ‘‘does not serve as a 
residence’’ is based upon the good faith 
determination of the lender that the 
structure is not intended for use or 
actually used as a residence, which 
generally includes sleeping, bathroom, 
or kitchen facilities.29 See also Q&A 
Exemptions 2. If one of these 
exemptions applies, a borrower may 
still elect to purchase flood insurance. 
Also, a lender may require flood 
insurance as a condition of making the 
loan, as a matter of safety and 
soundness. 

EXEMPTIONS 2. Does a lender have 
to take a security interest in the primary 
residential structure for detached 
structures to be eligible for the detached 
structure exemption? For example, 
suppose the house on a farm is not 
collateral, but all of the outbuildings 
including the barn, the equipment 
storage shed, and the silo (which are 
used for farm production), and a 
detached garage where the homeowner 
keeps his car, are taken as collateral. 
May the lender apply the detached 
structure exemption to the outbuildings? 
The lender does not have to take a 

security interest in the primary 
residential structure for detached 
structures to be eligible for the 
exemption, but the lender needs to 
evaluate the uses of detached structures 
to determine if they are eligible.30 The 
term ‘‘a structure that is part of a 
residential property’’ in the detached 
structure exemption applies only to 
structures for which there is a 
residential use and not to structures for 
which there is a commercial, 
agricultural, or other business use.31 In 
this example, only the garage is serving 
a residential use, so it could qualify for 
the exemption. The barn, equipment 
storage shed, and silo, which are used 

for farm production, would not qualify 
for the exemption. 

EXEMPTIONS 3. Is a flood hazard 
determination required even where the 
secured property may contain detached 
structures for which coverage is not 
required under the Regulation? 

Yes, as required under the Regulation, 

a flood hazard determination is needed 
to determine whether a building or 
mobile home securing a loan is or will 
be located in an SFHA where flood 
insurance is available under the Act. 
In order to determine whether the 
exemption for non-residential detached 
structures that are part of a residential 
property may apply, a flood hazard 
determination must be conducted first, 
without regard to whether there may be 
any detached structures that could be 
exempt.32 

EXEMPTIONS 4. If a borrower 

currently has a flood insurance policy 
on a detached structure that is part of 
residential property and the detached 
structure does not serve as a residence, 
may the lender or its servicer cancel its 
requirement to carry flood insurance on 
that structure? 

Yes. If a borrower has a flood 
insurance policy on a detached 
structure that is part of a residential 
property and does not serve as a 
residence, the lender is no longer 
mandated by the Act to require flood 
insurance on that structure.33 The 
lender may allow the borrower to cancel 
the policy. If warranted as a matter of 
safety and soundness, the lender may 
continue to require flood insurance 
coverage on the detached structure. 

EXEMPTIONS 5. In the event that a 

triggering event has occurred, is the 
lender required to review the intended 
use of each detached structure? 

Yes, a lender must examine the status 

of a detached structure upon a 
qualifying triggering event to determine 
whether the detached structure 
exemption still applies.34 See 
Applicability 13. There is no duty to 
monitor the status of a detached 
structure following the lender’s initial 
determination unless a triggering event 
occurs. However, regardless of the 
absence of a duty to monitor the status 
of a detached structure in the 
Regulation, sound risk management 
practices may lead a lender to conduct

scheduled periodic reviews that track 
the need for flood insurance on a loan 
portfolio. 

EXEMPTIONS 6. May a lender review 
current loans in its portfolio as the flood 
insurance policies renew and determine 
that it will no longer require flood 
insurance on a detached structure in an 
SFHA if the structure does not 
contribute to the value of the property 
securing the loan? 

A lender or servicer could initiate 
such a review; however, the Regulation 
does not permit the exemption of 
structures from the mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement based 
solely on whether the detached 
structure contributes value to the overall 
residential property securing the loan.35 
In the case of any residential property, 
flood insurance is not required on any 
structure that is part of such property as 
long as it is detached from the primary 
residential structure and does not serve 
as a residence.36 In addition, there are 
other exemptions that could apply: The 
exemption for State-owned property 
covered under a policy of self-insurance 
satisfactory to the Administrator of 
FEMA or the exemption for property 
securing any loan with an original 
principal balance of $5,000 or less and 
a repayment term of one year or less.37 
EXEMPTIONS 7. If a loan is secured 

by a residential property and the 
primary residential structure is joined to 
another building by a stairway or 
covered walkway, for purposes of 
Federal flood insurance requirements, 
would the other building qualify as a 
detached structure? 

For purposes of the detached 
structure exemption, a structure is 
‘‘detached’’ from the primary residential 
structure if it is not joined by any 
structural connection to that structure.38 
That is, a structure is ‘‘detached’’ if it 
stands alone. This definition is 
consistent with the coverage provision 
of the NFIP’s Standard Flood Insurance 
Policy (SFIP) for additions and 
extensions to the dwelling unit. See the 
NFIP Flood Insurance Manual. In this 
case, the other building would not 
qualify as a detached structure because 
it is attached to the primary residential

III. Private Flood Insurance— 
Mandatory Acceptance (Mandatory) 

MANDATORY 1. May a lender decide 

to only accept private flood insurance 
policies under the mandatory 
acceptance provision of the Regulation? 

Yes. A lender is only required to 
accept flood insurance policies issued 
by a private insurer that meet the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
under the Regulation, as long as the 
policy meets the amount of insurance 
required under the Regulation. A lender 
is not required to accept flood insurance 
policies that only meet the criteria set 
forth in the discretionary acceptance or 
mutual aid provision of the Regulation. 
MANDATORY 2. If a lender has a 
policy not to originate a mortgage in 
non-participating communities or 
coastal barrier regions where the NFIP is 
not available, do the private flood 
insurance requirements under the 
Regulation require a lender to change its 
policy? 

The Regulation does not require that 
a lender originate a loan that does not 
meet the lender’s underwriting criteria. 
The flood insurance purchase 
requirement only applies to loans 
secured by structures located or to be 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act.39 
The flood insurance purchase 
requirement does not apply within non- 
participating communities, where NFIP 
insurance is not available under the Act. 
See Q&A Applicability 1. Therefore, the 
lender does not need to change its 
policy of not originating mortgages in 
areas where NFIP insurance is 
unavailable solely because of the private 
flood insurance requirements under the 
Regulation. 

MANDATORY 3. Did the Agencies 
intend the compliance aid statement to 
act as a conformity clause that would 
make a private policy conform to the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’? 
No. The Agencies did not intend the 

compliance aid statement to act as a 
conformity clause. Rather, the 
compliance aid statement is intended to 
facilitate the ability of lenders, as well 
as consumers, to recognize policies that 
meet the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ and promote the consistent 
acceptance of policies that meet this 
definition. The compliance aid 
statement is intended to leverage the 
expertise of insurers to assist lenders in 
satisfying the ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
definition of the Regulation. 

39 Public Law 93–234, 87 Stat. 975 (1973). 

MANDATORY 4. Is a lender required 

to accept a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer that includes 
the compliance aid statement? 
Conversely, may a lender reject a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer solely because it does not 
contain the compliance aid statement? 
If a flood insurance policy issued by 

a private insurer includes the 
compliance aid statement, the lender 
may choose to rely upon the statement 
and would not need to review the policy 
further to determine if the policy meets 
the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance.’’ 

However, the lender is not required to 
accept this policy based upon inclusion 
of the compliance aid statement alone 
and may choose to make its own 
determination about whether the policy 
meets the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ or whether the policy is 
acceptable under the discretionary 
acceptance or mutual aid criteria.40 

If a flood insurance policy issued by 
a private insurer does not include the 
compliance aid statement, the lender 
may not reject the policy solely because 
it does not include this statement. The 
lender is not relieved from the 
requirement to accept a policy that 
meets the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance,’’ as long as the policy meets 
the amount of insurance required under 
the Regulation.41 Further, the lender 
may determine the policy is acceptable 
under the discretionary acceptance or 
mutual aid criteria. 

MANDATORY 5. If a flood insurance 

policy issued by a private insurer 
includes the compliance aid statement, 
does a lender need to conduct an 
additional review of the policy for 
compliance with the mandatory 
acceptance provision of the Regulation? 
No, under the mandatory acceptance 
provision of the Regulation, if a policy 
or an endorsement to the policy 
contains the compliance aid statement, 
further review is not necessary in order 
for the lender to determine that a policy 
meets the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance.’’ 42 It is important to note 
that, in order for the lender to rely on 
the compliance aid statement without 
further review of the policy, the 
language of the compliance aid 
statement must be stated in the policy, 

40 See 12 CFR 22.3(c) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3) 
(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(c) (NCUA). 

41 12 CFR 22.3(c)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(i) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(1) (FDIC); 12 CFR 
614.4930(c)(1) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(c)(1) 
(NCUA). 

42 12 CFR 22.3(c)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(ii) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(2) (FDIC); 12 CFR 
614.4930(c)(2) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(c)(2) 
(NCUA). 

or as an endorsement to the policy, as 
set forth in the Regulation.43 If the 
language is different from the 
compliance aid statement set forth in 
the Regulation, the lender cannot rely 
on the protections of the compliance aid 
statement in the Regulation and should 
review the policy to determine if it 
meets the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance.’’ However, a policy 
containing the compliance aid statement 
need not be rejected if there are stylistic 
differences, such as formatting, font, 
and punctuation that do not change the 
substantive meaning of the clause, from 
the compliance aid statement included 
in the Regulation. See also Q&A 
Mandatory 6. 

MANDATORY 6. Under the 

Regulation, what additional reviews 
does a lender need to conduct if the 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer includes the compliance 
aid statement? 

Although a lender may rely on the 
compliance aid statement to determine 
that a flood insurance policy meets the 
definition of ‘‘private flood insurance’’ 
in the Regulation, the lender must also 
ensure that the amount of insurance is 
at least equal to the lesser of the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
designated loan, or the maximum limit 
of coverage available for the particular 
type of property under the Act.44 See 
also Q&A Mandatory 5. 

MANDATORY 7. If a flood insurance 

policy issued by a private issuer does 
not include a compliance aid statement, 
can a lender use the criteria under the 
discretionary acceptance provision to 
decide whether to accept the policy 
without first checking to see if the policy 
meets the criteria under the mandatory 
acceptance provision? 

Yes, the lender may first review the 
policy to determine whether it meets the 
criteria under the discretionary 
acceptance provision.45 However, if the 
policy does not meet the discretionary 
acceptance criteria, the lender will still 
need to determine whether it must 
accept the policy under the mandatory 
acceptance criteria.46 

Note that if the lender accepts a 

policy under the discretionary

MANDATORY 8. If a lender only 
receives a declarations page without 
receiving a copy of the policy, and the 
declarations page includes the 
compliance aid statement, may the 
lender accept the policy? 

If the compliance aid statement is 
included on the declarations page, a 
lender may determine the policy meets 
the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance’’ without further review. 
However, a lender also must ensure that 
the policy meets the amount of 
insurance required under the 
Regulation. See Q&A Mandatory 6. 

MANDATORY 9. May a lender accept 

a private flood insurance policy that 
includes a compliance aid statement, 
but also includes a disclaimer 
explaining that the ‘‘insurer is not 
licensed in the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property is located,’’ which 
suggests that the policy is issued by a 
surplus lines insurer? 

Even if the policy includes a 

statement indicating that the insurer is 
not licensed in the State or jurisdiction 
in which the property is located, 
suggesting that the policy is issued by 
a surplus lines insurer, but contains a 
compliance aid statement, lenders may 
accept the policy as long as the policy 
complies with the Regulation and 
applicable State laws. See Q&A Private 
Flood Compliance 10. 

IV. Private Flood Insurance— 
Discretionary Acceptance 
(Discretionary) 

DISCRETIONARY 1. Are lenders 
required to accept flood insurance 
policies that meet the discretionary 
acceptance criteria? 

No, the discretionary acceptance 
criteria in the Regulation sets forth the 
minimum acceptable criteria that a 
flood insurance policy must have for the 
lender to accept the policy under the 
discretionary acceptance provision. It is 
at the lender’s discretion to accept a 
policy that meets the discretionary 
acceptance criteria so long as the policy 
does not meet the mandatory acceptance 
criteria. 

DISCRETIONARY 2. If the lender 

determines that a flood insurance policy 
meets the discretionary acceptance 
criteria and accepts that policy, what 
documentation will demonstrate that 
the policy provides sufficient protection 

47 12 CFR 22.3(c)(3) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(c)(3)(iii) (Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(3) (FDIC); 
12 CFR 614.4930(c)(3) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.3(c)(3) (NCUA). 

of the loan, consistent with general 
safety and soundness principles? 

The Regulation requires the lender to 
document its conclusion in writing that 
the policy provides sufficient protection 
of the loan, consistent with general 
safety and soundness principles. See 
also Q&A Discretionary 4. This review 
may be performed and recorded 
electronically. While the Regulation 
does not require any specific 
documentation to demonstrate that the 
policy provides sufficient protection of 
the loan, lenders may include any 
information that reasonably supports 
the lender’s conclusion following 
review of the policy. 

DISCRETIONARY 3. How can a 
lender evaluate the sufficiency of an 
insurer’s solvency, strength, and ability 
to satisfy claims when determining 
whether a flood insurance policy 
provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles? 

A lender may evaluate an insurer’s 
solvency, strength, and ability to satisfy 
claims by obtaining information from 
the State insurance regulator’s office of 
the State in which the property securing 
the loan is located, among other options. 
A lender can rely on the licensing or 
other processes used by the State 
insurance regulator for such an 
evaluation. See Q&A Discretionary 4. 
DISCRETIONARY 4. What are some 
factors to consider when determining 
whether a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer under the 
discretionary acceptance provision or a 
mutual aid plan provides sufficient 
protection of a loan secured by 
improved real property located in an 
SFHA, consistent with general safety 
and soundness principles? 

Some factors, among others, that a 
lender could consider in determining 
whether a policy provides sufficient 
protection of a loan include whether: (1) 
A policy’s deductible is reasonable 
based on the borrower’s financial 
condition; (2) the insurer provides 
adequate notice of cancellation to the 
mortgagor and mortgagee to allow for 
timely force placement of flood 
insurance, if necessary; (3) the terms 
and conditions of the policy, with 
respect to payment per occurrence or 
per loss and aggregate limits, are 
adequate to protect the regulated 
lending institution’s interest in the 
collateral; (4) the flood insurance policy 
complies with applicable State 
insurance laws; and (5) the private 
insurance company has the financial 
solvency, strength, and ability to satisfy 
claims. 

V. Private Flood Insurance—General 
Compliance (Private Flood Compliance) 
PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 1. 

What is the maximum deductible a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer can have for residential 
or commercial properties located in an 
SFHA? 

The maximum deductible for a flood 

insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer varies depending on whether the 
lender accepts the policy under the 
mandatory acceptance or the 
discretionary acceptance provision. For 
purposes of compliance with the 
mandatory acceptance provision, the 
Regulation provides that a policy must 
provide coverage at least as broad as the 
coverage provided under an SFIP for the 
same type of property, including a 
deductible that is no higher than the 
specified maximum under an SFIP for 
any total coverage amount up to the 
maximum available under the NFIP at 
the time the policy is provided to the 
lender.48 For a private policy with a 
coverage amount exceeding that 
available under the NFIP, the deductible 
may exceed the specific maximum 
deductible under an SFIP. However, for 
safety and soundness purposes, the 
lender should consider whether the 
deductible is reasonable based on the 
borrower’s financial condition, among 
other factors. See Q&A Amount 9. 

• For example, if a private policy for 

a commercial building provided 
$1,000,000 of flood insurance coverage, 
which is in excess of the NFIP 
maximum coverage of $500,000 for a 
commercial building, then it would be 
acceptable for a million-dollar policy to 
have a deductible higher than the 
maximum deductible for a policy 
available under the NFIP. The lender 
should consider whether the deductible 
is reasonable based on the borrower’s 
financial condition. 

• Similarly, if a private policy for a 

residential building provided 
$1,000,000 of flood insurance coverage, 
which is in excess of the NFIP 
maximum coverage of $250,000 for a 
residential building, then it would be 
acceptable for a million-dollar policy to 
have a deductible higher than the 
maximum deductible for a policy 
available under the NFIP. The lender 
should consider whether the deductible 
is reasonable based on the borrower’s 
financial condition. 

For purposes of compliance with the 
discretionary acceptance provision, the 
Regulation requires that the policy 
provide sufficient protection of the loan, 

48 12 CFR 22.2(k) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(b)(9) 
(Board); 12 CFR 339.2 (FDIC): 12 CFR 614.4925 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA).

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

consistent with safety and soundness 
principles.49 Among the factors a lender 
could consider in determining whether 
a policy provides sufficient protection 
of a loan is whether the policy’s 
deductible is reasonable based on the 
borrower’s financial condition. Unlike 
the limitation on deductibles for 
policies accepted under the mandatory 
acceptance provision for any total 
coverage amount up to the maximum 
available under the NFIP, a lender can 
accept a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer under the 
discretionary acceptance provision with 
a deductible higher than that for an SFIP 
for a similar type of property, provided 
the lender has determined the policy 
provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with safety and 
soundness principles. 

Whether the lender is evaluating the 
policy under the mandatory acceptance 
provision or the discretionary 
acceptance provision, a lender may not 
allow the borrower to use a deductible 
amount equal to the insurable value of 
the property to avoid the mandatory 
purchase requirement for flood 
insurance.50 However, a lender may 
accept a private flood insurance policy 
covering multiple buildings regardless 
of whether any single building covered 
by the policy has an insurable value 
lower than the amount of the per 
occurrence deductible. See Q&A 
Amount 9, Q&A Amount 10, and Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 2. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 2. 
May a lender require that the deductible 
of any flood insurance policy issued by 
a private insurer be lower than the 
maximum deductible for an SFIP? 

Yes. If the lender is accepting the 

private flood insurance policy under the 
mandatory acceptance provision, the 
Regulation requires that the private 
flood insurance policy be at least as 
broad as an SFIP, which includes a 
requirement that the private flood 
insurance policy contain a deductible 
no higher than the specified maximum 
deductible for an SFIP.51 The lender 
may require a borrower’s private flood 
insurance policy deductible to be lower 
than the maximum deductible for an 
SFIP in connection with a policy that 
the lender accepts under the mandatory 
acceptance provision, consistent with 

49 12 CFR 22.3(c)(3)(iv) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(c)(3)(iii)(D) (Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(3)(iv) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(3)(iv) (FCA); and 12 
CFR 760.3(c)(3)(iv) (NCUA). 

50 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

51 12 CFR 22.2(k)(2)(iii) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(b)(9)(ii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR 339.2 (FDIC); 12 
CFR 614.4925 (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA). 

general safety and soundness principles 
and based on a borrower’s financial 
condition, among other factors. 

If the lender is accepting a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer under the discretionary 
acceptance provision, the lender need 
only consider whether the policy, 
including the stated deductible, 
provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with general safety and 
soundness principles.52 See also Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 1. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 3. If 
a lender utilizes a third party to review 
flood insurance policies, would it be 
permissible for a lender to charge the 
borrower a fee for this review? 

The Act and the Regulation do not 
prohibit lenders from charging fees to 
borrowers for contracting with third 
parties to review flood insurance 
policies issued by private insurers. As 
explained in Q&A Fees 1 and Q&A Fees 
2, lenders may charge limited, 
reasonable fees for flood determinations 
and life-of-loan monitoring. Similarly, 
the Act and the Regulation do not 
prohibit lenders from charging a fee to 
a borrower when a third party reviews 
a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer. However, lenders 
should be aware of any other applicable 
requirements regarding fees and 
disclosures of fees. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 4. If 

the policy is not available prior to 
closing, what can the lender rely on to 
make sure the policy meets the private 
flood insurance requirements of the 
Regulation? 

The Act and Regulation do not specify 

the acceptable types of documentation 
for a lender to rely on when reviewing 
a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer. Lenders should 
determine whether they have sufficient 
evidence to show the policy meets the 
private flood insurance requirements 
under the Regulation. 

Lenders can take steps to help 

mitigate against closing delays such as 
designating employees responsible for 
reviewing flood policies, training 
employees, and requesting additional 
information from insurers early in the 
process. If the lender does not have 
enough information to determine if the 
policy meets the private flood insurance 
requirements under the Regulation, then 
the lender should timely request 
additional information as necessary to 
complete its review. See also Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 5. 

52 12 CFR 22.3(c)(3)(iv)(D) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(c)(3)(iii)(D) (Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(3)(iv) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(3)(iv) (FCA); and 12 
CFR 760.3(c)(3)(iv) (NCUA). 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 5. 

Under existing force placement 
requirements, a declarations page is 
sufficient to evidence a borrower’s 
purchase of a flood insurance policy. 
Does the declarations page have 
sufficient information for a lender to 
determine whether the policy complies 
with the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation? 

It depends. If the declarations page 
provides enough information for the 
lender to determine whether the policy 
meets the mandatory acceptance 
provision or discretionary acceptance 
provision of the Regulation or if the 
declarations pages contains the 
compliance aid statement, then the 
lender may rely on the declarations 
pages. However, if the declarations page 
does not provide enough information for 
the lender to determine whether the 
policy satisfies the mandatory 
acceptance provision or discretionary 
acceptance provision of the Regulation, 
the lender should request additional 
information about the policy to aid in 
making its determination. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 6. 
May a lender accept a multiple-peril 
policy issued by a private insurer to 
satisfy the mandatory purchase of flood 
insurance requirement? 

Yes. A lender can accept a multiple- 

peril policy that covers the hazard of 
flood, either in the policy or as an 
endorsement, under the private flood 
insurance provisions of the Regulation. 
PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 7. 

How do the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation, 
especially the compliance aid 
statement, work in conjunction with the 
requirements from secondary market 
investors (for example, the Federal 
National Mortgage Association (Fannie 
Mae) or the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac))? 
Lenders must comply with Federal 

flood insurance requirements. The 
requirements for the secondary market 
are separate from the Regulation. A 
lender should carefully review these 
separate requirements for secondary 
market investors regarding acceptable 
private flood insurance if the lender 
plans to sell loans to such investors and 
should direct questions regarding these 
requirements to the appropriate entities. 
PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 8. 
When servicing a loan covered by flood 
insurance pursuant to the Act and the 
Regulation, which requirements must a 
servicer follow in evaluating the 
acceptance of a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer? 

For loans serviced on behalf of 

lenders supervised by the Agencies, the 
servicer must comply with the

Regulation in determining whether a 
flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer must be accepted under 
the mandatory acceptance provision or 
may be accepted under the discretionary 
acceptance provision or mutual aid 
provision. For loans serviced on behalf 
of other entities not supervised by the 
Agencies, the servicer should comply 
with the terms of its contract with that 
entity. For example, when servicing 
loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac, where there are insurer 
rating requirements specified within 
those entities’ servicing guidance or 
other relevant authorities that are not 
required in the Regulation, the servicer 
should adhere to those servicing 
requirements. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 9. 
How can a lender determine: (i) whether 
an insurer is licensed or admitted in a 
particular State, (ii) or whether a 
surplus lines or nonadmitted alien 
insurer is permitted to issue an 
insurance policy in a particular State? 
A lender may refer to the website of 
the State insurance regulator where the 
collateral property is located to 
determine whether a particular insurer 
is licensed, admitted, or otherwise 
permitted to issue an insurance policy 
in a particular State. If the lender cannot 
determine this information from the 
website, the lender could contact the 
State insurance regulator directly. 
Further, information with respect to 
surplus lines insurer eligibility also may 
be available in the Consumer Insurance 
Search (CIS) tool available on the 
National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (NAIC) website. Lenders 
may consult commercial service 
providers regarding the eligibility of 
surplus lines insurers in particular 
States provided the lenders have a 
reasonable basis to believe that these 
service providers have reliable 
information. With regard to 
nonadmitted alien insurers in 
particular, lenders could review the 
NAIC’s Quarterly Listing of Alien 
Insurers.53 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 10. 
May lenders accept policies issued by 
private insurers that are surplus lines 
insurers for noncommercial properties? 
Yes, if the surplus lines insurer is 
eligible or not disapproved to place 
insurance in the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property to be insured is 
located, lenders may accept policies 
issued by surplus lines insurers as 
coverage for noncommercial (i.e., 
residential) properties. 

53 https://www.naic.org/prod_serv_alpha_

listing.htm#quarterly_alien. 

Consistent with the Act and the 
Regulation, the Agencies confirm that 
policies issued by surplus lines insurers 
for noncommercial properties are 
covered in the definition of ‘‘private 
flood insurance’’ and in the 
discretionary acceptance provision. In 
the definition of ‘‘private flood 
insurance,’’ surplus lines policies for 
noncommercial properties are covered 
as policies that are issued by insurance 
companies that are ‘‘otherwise approved 
to engage in the business of insurance 
by the insurance regulator of the State 
or jurisdiction in which the property to 
be insured is located.’’ 54 Similarly, 
within the discretionary acceptance 
provision, noncommercial residential 
policies issued by surplus lines carriers 
are covered as policies that are issued 
by private insurance companies that are 
‘‘otherwise approved to engage in the 
business of insurance by the insurance 
regulator of the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property to be insured is 
located.’’ 55 

For purposes of the Regulation, the 
meaning of ‘‘otherwise approved’’ is 
based on whether applicable State law 
provides that the surplus lines insurer is 
eligible or not disapproved to place 
insurance in that State. Even if the 
surplus lines insurer is not considered 
to be engaged in the business of 
insurance under applicable State law, 
the surplus lines insurer would still be 
‘‘otherwise approved’’ only for purposes 
of this provision of the Regulation if the 
insurer is eligible or not disapproved to 
place insurance in the State. 

PRIVATE FLOOD COMPLIANCE 11. 

When must a lender review a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer under the private flood 
insurance requirements of the 
Regulation? 

Any time the borrower presents the 

lender with a new flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer, 
regardless of whether a triggering event 
occurred, the lender must review the 
policy to determine whether it meets the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation.56 A lender may 
determine that the policy meets the 
mandatory acceptance criteria without 
further review if the policy or an 

endorsement to the policy includes the 
compliance aid statement.57 If there is 
no compliance aid statement, or the 
lender chooses not to rely on the 
compliance aid statement, the lender 
must conduct its own review to 
determine if the policy meets the 
mandatory acceptance criteria. See Q&A 
Mandatory 4. If the policy does not meet 
the mandatory acceptance criteria, the 
lender may still accept the policy if it 
meets the discretionary acceptance 
criteria, or, if applicable, the mutual aid 
plan criteria. See also Q&A Mandatory 
7. If the policy does not meet the 
mandatory acceptance, discretionary 
acceptance, or mutual aid plan criteria, 
the lender may not accept the policy.58 
If the lender has previously reviewed 

the flood insurance policy under the 
mandatory acceptance provision, the 
discretionary acceptance provision, or 
the mutual aid plan provision the lender 
may rely on its previous review, 
provided there are no changes to the 
terms of the policy that would affect the 
acceptance under the Regulation. The 
lender’s previous written 
documentation will constitute the 
documentation required under the 
Regulation each time the policy comes 
up for renewal. The lender should have 
effective internal controls in place 
through appropriate policies, 
procedures, training, and monitoring to 
ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the Regulation. 

VI. Standard Flood Hazard 
Determination Form (SFHDF) 

SFHDF 1. Does the SFHDF replace the 

borrower notification form? 

No. The SFHDF is used by the lender 

to determine whether the building or 
mobile home offered as collateral 
security for a loan is or will be located 
in an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act.59 The 
notification form, on the other hand, is 
used to notify the borrower(s) that the 
building or mobile home is or will be 
located in an SFHA and to inform the 
borrower(s) about flood insurance 
requirements and the availability of 
Federal disaster relief assistance.60 

SFHDF 2. May a lender provide the 

SFHDF to the borrower? 

54 See 84 FR 4953, 4955–4956 (Feb. 20, 2019). See 

also 12 CFR 22.2(k)(1)(i) (OCC); 12 CFR

32876 

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Yes. Although not a statutory 

requirement, a lender may provide a 
copy of the flood determination to the 
borrower. In the event a lender provides 
the SFHDF to the borrower, the 
signature of the borrower is not required 
to acknowledge receipt of the form. The 
Agencies note that under the FEMA 
process for a Letter of Determination 
Review (LODR), a lender would need to 
make the determination available to the 
borrower. 

SFHDF 3. May the SFHDF be used in 

electronic format? 

Yes.61 In the final rule adopting the 
SFHDF, FEMA stated: ‘‘If an electronic 
format is used, the format and exact 
layout of the Standard Flood Hazard 
Determination Form is not required, but 
the fields and elements listed on the 
form are required. Any electronic format 
used by lenders must contain all 
mandatory fields indicated on the 
form.’’ It should be noted that the lender 
must be able to reproduce the form 
upon receiving a document request by 
its Federal supervisory agency. 

SFHDF 4. May a lender rely on a 

previous determination for a refinancing 
or assumption of a loan or multiple 
loans to the same borrower secured by 
the same property? 

It depends. The Act (42 U.S.C. 

4104b(e)) permits a lender to rely on a 
previous flood determination using the 
SFHDF when it increases, extends, 
renews, or purchases a loan secured by 
a building or a mobile home. Under the 
Act, the ‘‘making’’ of a loan is not listed 
as a permissible event that permits a 
lender to rely on a previous 
determination. When the loan involves 
a refinancing or assumption by the same 
lender who obtained the original flood 
determination on the same property, the 
lender may rely on the previous 
determination only if the original 
determination was made not more than 
seven years before the date of the 
transaction, the basis for the 
determination was set forth on the 
SFHDF, and there were no map 
revisions or updates affecting the 
security property since the original 
determination was made. Further, if the 
same lender makes multiple loans to the 
same borrower secured by the same 
improved real estate, the lender may 
rely on its previous determination if the 
original determination was made not 
more than seven years before the date of 
the transaction, the basis for the 
determination was set forth on the 
SFHDF, and there were no map 
revisions or updates affecting the 

security property since the original 
determination was made. These loans 
are extended by the same lender, to the 
same borrower, and are secured by the 
same improved real estate, and, 
therefore, these types of transactions are 
the functional equivalent of an increase 
of a loan. 

When the loan involves a refinancing 

or assumption made by a lender 
different from the one who obtained the 
original determination, this would 
constitute the making of a new loan, 
thereby requiring a new determination. 

VII. Flood Insurance Determination 
Fees (Fees) 

FEES 1. When can lenders or servicers 

charge the borrower a fee for making a 
determination? 

There are four instances under the Act 

and Regulation when the borrower can 
be charged a fee for a flood 
determination: 

• When the determination is made in 
connection with the making, increasing, 
extending, or renewing of a loan that is 
initiated by the borrower; 

• When the determination reflects a 

revision or updating by FEMA of 
floodplain areas or flood-risk zones; 
• When the determination reflects 

FEMA’s publication of a notice or 
compendium that affects the area in 
which the security property is located, 
or FEMA requires a determination as to 
whether the building securing the loan 
is located in an SFHA; or 

• When the determination results in 

force placement of insurance.62 

Loan or other contractual documents 
between the parties may also permit the 
imposition of fees. 

FEES 2. May charges made for life-of- 

loan reviews by flood determination 
firms be passed along to the borrower? 
Yes, with limitations noted below. In 
addition to the initial determination at 
the time a loan is made, increased, 
renewed, or extended, many flood 
determination firms provide a service to 
the lender to review and report changes 
in the flood status of a dwelling for the 
entire term of the loan (i.e., life-of-loan 
monitoring). The fee charged for the 
service at loan closing is a composite fee 
for conducting both the original and 
subsequent reviews. Charging a fee for 
the original determination is clearly 
authorized by the Act. The Agencies 
agree that a determination fee may 
include, among other things, reasonable 
fees for a lender, servicer, or third party 
to monitor the flood hazard status of 
property securing a loan in order to 

make determinations on an ongoing 
basis. 

However, the life-of-loan fee is based 

on the authority to charge a 
determination fee and, therefore, the 
composite determination/life-of-loan 
monitoring fee may be charged only if 
the events specified in the answer to 
Q&A Fees 1 occur.63 Further, a lender 
may not charge a composite 
determination and life-of-loan fee if the 
loan does not close, because such life- 
of loan fee would be an unearned fee in 
violation of the Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act.64 

VIII. Flood Zone Discrepancies (Zone) 

ZONE 1. Does a lender need to 
reconcile a discrepancy between the 
flood zone designation on the flood 
determination form and the flood zone 
associated with a flood insurance 
policy? 

No, a lender need not reconcile or 
otherwise be concerned with a flood 
zone discrepancy. For NFIP policies 
issued under FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0— 
Equity in Action (Risk Rating 2.0), 65 
premium rates are no longer determined 
by the flood zone in which the property 
is located. Moreover, the flood zone is 
no longer included on the declarations 
page for NFIP policies issued under Risk 
Rating 2.0. 

Flood insurance policies issued by a 

private insurer may still include the 
flood zone on the declarations page. 
Further, NFIP policies that have not 
been issued or renewed under Risk 
Rating 2.0 will include the flood zone 
on the declarations page.66 In these 
cases, lenders also need not reconcile 
any discrepancy. 

The flood zone determination is still 
necessary to determine if a property is 
located in an SFHA. If the SFHDF 
indicates that the building securing the 
loan is in an SFHA, the lender must 
require the appropriate amount of 
insurance coverage in accordance with 
the Act and Regulation.67 For disputes 
regarding whether a property is located 
in an SFHA, see Q&A Zone 3.

Regulation if there is a discrepancy

March 31, 2022, may or may not be renewed under 
Risk Rating 2.0. All NFIP policies that renew on or 
after April 1, 2022 will be renewed under Risk 
Rating 2.0.

32877 

between the flood zone on the SFHDF 
and the flood zone associated with a 
flood insurance policy? 

No, a lender is not in violation of the 

Regulation if there is a discrepancy 
between the flood zone on the SFHDF 
and the flood zone associated with the 
policy. See Q&A Zone 1. 

ZONE 3. What should a lender do 

when the lender’s flood zone 
determination specifies that a building 
securing the loan is located in an SFHA 
requiring mandatory flood insurance 
coverage, but the borrower disputes that 
determination? 

If a borrower disputes a lender’s 

determination that the building securing 
the loan is located in an SFHA requiring 
mandatory flood insurance coverage, the 
parties involved in making the 
determination are encouraged to resolve 
the flood zone discrepancy before 
contacting FEMA for a final 
determination. If the flood zone 
discrepancy cannot be resolved, an 
appeal may be filed with FEMA. 
Depending on the nature of the dispute, 
FEMA has different options for review, 
including: 

• Letters of Determination Review 

(LODR), and 

• Letters of Map Change (LOMC), 

which include Letters of Map 
Amendment (LOMA), Letters of Map 
Revision (LOMR), and Letters of Map 
Revision Based on Fill (LOMR–F). 

Lenders and borrowers should consult 

FEMA guidance on the appropriate 
process to follow, any applicable fees, 
and any deadlines by which the request 
to review must be made. However, as 
long as the lender’s flood determination 
specifies that a building securing the 
loan is located in an SFHA and requires 
mandatory flood insurance coverage, 
sufficient coverage must be in place in 
accordance with the Act and the 
Regulation until FEMA has determined 
that the building is not in an SFHA.68 

IX. Notice of Special Flood Hazards 
and Availability of Federal Disaster 
Relief (Notice) 

NOTICE 1. Does the Notice of Special 

Flood Hazards have to be provided to 
each borrower for a real estate related 
loan? 

No. The Notice of Special Flood 

Hazards must be provided to one 
borrower when the lender determines 
that the property securing the loan is or 
will be located in an SFHA.69 In a 
transaction involving multiple 

68 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

borrowers, the lender need only provide 
the Notice of Special Flood Hazards to 
any one of the borrowers in the 
transaction. Lenders may provide 
multiple notices if they choose. The 
lender and borrower(s) typically 
designate the borrower to whom the 
Notice of Special Flood Hazards will be 
provided. 

NOTICE 2. When should a lender 
provide the Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards to the borrower? How does this 
requirement apply in situations 
regarding mobile homes where the 
lender may not know where the home is 
to be located until just prior to, or 
sometimes after, the time of loan 
closing? 

As required by the Regulation, a 
lender must provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower 
within a reasonable time before the 
completion of the transaction.70 What 
constitutes ‘‘reasonable’’ notice will 
necessarily vary according to the 
circumstances of particular transactions. 
A lender should bear in mind, however, 
that a borrower should receive timely 
notice to ensure that (1) the borrower 
has the opportunity to become aware of 
the borrower’s responsibilities under the 
Act; and (2) where applicable, the 
borrower can purchase flood insurance 
before completion of the loan 
transaction. The Agencies generally 
regard 10 calendar days as a 
‘‘reasonable’’ time interval. 

If a lender determines that a mobile 
home securing a designated loan will be 
located in an SFHA just prior to closing, 
the lender may need to delay the closing 
until the Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards has been provided in 
accordance with the Regulation. 
In the case of loan transactions 

secured by mobile homes not located on 
a permanent foundation, the Agencies 
note that such ‘‘home only’’ transactions 
are excluded from the definition of 
mobile home and the notice 
requirements would not apply to these 
transactions. However, the Agencies 
encourage a lender to advise the 
borrower that if the mobile home is later 
located on a permanent foundation in 
an SFHA, flood insurance will be 
required. If the lender, when notified of 
the location of the mobile home 
subsequent to the loan closing, 
determines that it has been placed on a 
permanent foundation and is located in 
an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act, flood insurance 
coverage becomes mandatory and a 
force placement notice must be given to 

the borrower under those provisions.71 
If the borrower fails to purchase flood 
insurance coverage within 45 days after 
notification, the lender must force-place 
the insurance.72 

NOTICE 3. When is the lender 

required to provide notice to the servicer 
of a loan that flood insurance is 
required? 

Because the servicer of a loan is often 

not identified prior to the closing of a 
loan, the Regulation requires that notice 
be provided no later than the time the 
lender transmits other loan data, such as 
information concerning hazard 
insurance and taxes, to the servicer.73 
NOTICE 4. What will constitute 
appropriate form of notice to the 
servicer? 

Delivery to the servicer of a copy of 

the notice given to the borrower is 
appropriate notice. The Regulation also 
provides that the notice can be made 
either electronically or by a written 
copy.74 

In the case of a servicer affiliated with 

the lender, the Act requires the lender 
to notify the servicer of special flood 
hazards and the Regulation reflects this 
requirement. Neither the Act nor the 
Regulation contains an exception for 
affiliates.75 

NOTICE 5. How long must the lender 

maintain the record of receipt by the 
borrower of the Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards? 

The record of receipt provided by the 

borrower must be maintained for the 
period of time that the lender owns the 
loan.76 Examples of a record of receipt 
include: the borrower’s signed 
acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice 
of Special Flood Hazards; the borrower’s 
initials on a form that acknowledges 
receipt; the borrower’s electronic 
signature that acknowledges receipt, or 
a certified return receipt if the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards was mailed to 
the borrower. Lenders may keep the 
record in the form that best suits the 
lender’s business practices. Lenders 
may retain the record electronically, but

they must be able to retrieve the record 
within a reasonable time pursuant to a 
document request from their Federal 
supervisory agency. 

NOTICE 6. Can a lender rely on a 

previous Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards if it is less than seven years old, 
and it is the same property, same 
borrower, and same lender? 

The Regulation does not waive the 
requirement to provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the borrower. 
Although subsequent transactions by 
the same lender with respect to the 
same property are the functional 
equivalent of a renewal and do not 
require a new determination, the lender 
must still provide a new Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards to the 
borrower.77 

NOTICE 7. Is use of the sample form 

of Notice of Special Flood Hazards 
mandatory? 

Although lenders are required to 

provide a Notice of Special Flood 
Hazards to a borrower when they make, 
increase, extend, or renew a loan 
secured by an improved structure 
located in an SFHA,78 use of the sample 
form of Notice of Special Flood Hazards 
provided in appendix A of the 
Regulation is not mandatory. It should 
be noted that the sample form includes 
other information in addition to what is 
required by the Act and the Regulation. 
Lenders may personalize, change the 
format of, and add information to the 
sample form of notice, if they choose. 
However, a lender-revised Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards must provide the 
borrower with at least the minimum 
information required by the Act and 
Regulation.79 Therefore, lenders should 
consult the Act and Regulation to 
determine the information needed. 

X. Determining the Appropriate 
Amount of Flood Insurance Required 
(Amount) 

AMOUNT 1. The Regulation states 

that the amount of flood insurance 
required ‘‘must be at least equal to the 
lesser of the outstanding principal 
balance of the designated loan or the 
maximum limit of coverage available for 
the particular type of property under the 
Act.’’ What is meant by the ‘‘maximum 
limit of coverage available for the 
particular type of property under the 
Act’’? 

77 12 CFR 22.9(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(i) (Board); 

12 CFR 339.9(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4955(a) (FCA); 
and 12 CFR 760.9(a) (NCUA). 

78 12 CFR 22.9(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(i) (Board); 

12 CFR 339.9(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4955(a) (FCA); 
and 12 CFR 760.9(a) (NCUA). 

79 12 U.S.C. 4104a(a)(3); 12 CFR 22.9(b) (OCC); 12 
CFR 208.25(i)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.9(b) (FDIC); 12 
CFR 614.4955(b) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.9(b) 
(NCUA). 

The maximum limit of coverage 
available for the particular type of 
property under the Act depends on the 
value of the secured collateral. First, 
under the NFIP, there are maximum 
caps on the amount of insurance 
available for buildings located in a 
participating community under the 
Regular Program. For single-family and 
two-to-four family dwellings and 
individually owned condominium units 
insured under the Dwelling Form 
policy, the maximum limit is $250,000. 
For a residential condominium building 
insured under the Residential 
Condominium Building Association 
Policy (RCBAP) form, the maximum 
amount of insurance available is 
$250,000 multiplied by the number of 
units. For all other buildings insured 
under the General Property Form, the 
maximum limit of building coverage 
available is $500,000. This includes all 
non-residential buildings, mixed-use 
condominium buildings not eligible for 
coverage under the RCBAP, and other 
residential buildings of five or more 
families, such as cooperatives or 
apartment buildings in the non- 
condominium form of ownership. (In 
participating communities that are 
under the emergency program phase, 
the maximum limits of insurance are 
different.) The maximum limit for 
contents insured under the Dwelling 
Form and RCBAP is $100,000 ($100,000 
total, not per unit) and $500,000 for 
contents insured under the General 
Property Form. See NFIP Flood 
Insurance Manual. 

In addition to the maximum caps 
under the NFIP, the Regulation also 
provides that ‘‘flood insurance coverage 
under the Act is limited to the building 
or mobile home and any personal 
property that secures a loan and not the 
land itself,’’ which is commonly 
referred to as the ‘‘insurable value’’ of a 
structure.80 The NFIP does not insure 
land; therefore, land values are not 
included in the calculation.81 

An NFIP policy will not cover an 

amount exceeding the ‘‘insurable value’’ 
of the structure, so the maximum 
amount of insurance coverage is the 
applicable limit available under the 
NFIP or the insurable value, whichever 
is less. In determining coverage amounts 
for flood insurance, lenders often follow 
the same practice used to establish other 
hazard insurance coverage amounts. 
However, unlike the insurable valuation 
used to underwrite most other hazard 

80 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

insurance policies, the insurable value 
of improved real estate for flood 
insurance purposes also includes the 
repair or replacement cost of the 
foundation and supporting structures. It 
is very important to calculate the correct 
insurable value of the property; 
otherwise, the lender might 
inadvertently require the borrower to 
purchase too much or too little flood 
insurance coverage. For example, if the 
lender fails to exclude the value of the 
land when determining the insurable 
value of the improved real estate, the 
borrower will be asked to purchase 
coverage that exceeds the amount the 
NFIP will pay in the event of a loss. 
(Please note, however, when taking a 
security interest in improved real estate 
where the value of the land, excluding 
the value of the improvements, is 
sufficient collateral for the debt, the 
lender must nonetheless require flood 
insurance to cover the value of the 
structure if it is located in a 
participating community’s SFHA.) 82 
AMOUNT 2. What is the ‘‘insurable 
value’’ of a building and how is it used 
to determine the required amount of 
flood insurance? 

The insurable value of the building 

may generally be the same as 100 
percent Replacement Cost Value (RCV), 
which is the cost to replace the building 
with the same kind of material and 
construction without deduction for 
depreciation. In calculating the amount 
of insurance to require, the lender and 
borrower (either by themselves or in 
consultation with the flood insurance 
provider or other appropriate 
professional) may choose from a variety 
of approaches or methods to establish 
the insurable value. They may use an 
appraisal based on a cost-value (not 
market-value) approach, a construction- 
cost calculation, the insurable value 
used on a hazard insurance policy 
(recognizing that the insurable value for 
flood insurance purposes may differ 
from the coverage provided by the 
hazard insurance and that adjustments 
may be necessary), the replacement cost 
value listed on the flood insurance 
policy declarations page, or any other 
reasonable approach, so long as it can be 
supported. 

AMOUNT 3. What are examples of 

residential buildings? 

A residential building is a non- 
commercial building designed for 
habitation by one or more families or a 
mixed-use building that qualifies as a 
single-family, 2–4 family, or other 
residential building.

32879 

The NFIP provides the following 

definitions: 

• A single family dwelling is either a 

residential single-family building in 
which the total floor area devoted to 
non-residential uses is less than 50 
percent of the building’s total floor area, 
or a single-family residential unit within 
a 2–4 family building, other-residential 
building, business, or non-residential 
building, in which commercial uses 
within the unit are limited to less than 
50 percent of the unit’s total floor area. 
• A 2–4 family residential building is 

a residential building, containing 2–4 
residential units and in which non- 
residential uses are limited to less than 
25 percent of the building’s total floor 
area. This category includes apartment 
buildings and condominium buildings. 
It excludes hotels and motels with 
normal room rentals for less than six 
months. 

• An other residential building is a 
residential building containing five or 
more residential units or a mixed-use 
building in which the total floor area 
devoted to non-residential uses is less 
than 25 percent of the building’s total 
floor area. This category includes 
condominium and apartment buildings 
as well as hotels, motels, tourist homes, 
and rooming houses where the normal 
occupancy of a guest is six months or 
more. Additional examples of other 
residential buildings include 
dormitories and assisted-living 
facilities. 

For more complete information, refer 

to the NFIP Flood Insurance Manual. 
AMOUNT 4. What are examples of 

non-residential buildings? 

Pursuant to the NFIP Flood Insurance 

Manual, a non-residential building 
includes: 

1. A building in which the named 

insured is a commercial enterprise 
primarily carried out to generate income 
and the coverage is for: 

• A building not designed for 

habitation or residential uses; 

• A mixed-use building in which the 

total floor area devoted to residential 
uses is 50 percent or less of the total 
floor area within the building if the 
residential building is a single-family 
property; or 75 percent or less of the 
total floor area within the building for 
all other residential properties; or 
• A building designed for use as 
office or retail space, wholesale space, 
hospitality space, or for similar uses. 

• The following buildings where the 
normal occupancy of a guest is less than 
six months: Condominium buildings, 
apartment buildings, hotels and motels, 
tourist homes, or rooming houses. 

2. Other non-residential buildings 

including, but not limited to the 

following: Houses of worship, schools, 
agricultural structures, garages, pool 
houses, clubhouses, and recreational 
buildings. 

For more complete information, refer 

to the NFIP Flood Insurance Manual. 

AMOUNT 5. How much insurance is 

required on a building located in an 
SFHA in a participating community? 

The amount of insurance required by 
the Act and Regulation is the lesser of: 
• The outstanding principal balance 

of the loan(s); or 

• The maximum amount of insurance 

available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ The maximum limit available for 

the type of structure; or 

Æ The ‘‘insurable value’’ of the 

structure.83 

Example: (Calculating insurance 

required on a non-residential building): 
Loan security includes one equipment 

shed located in an SFHA in a 
participating community under the 
Regular Program. 

• Outstanding loan principal balance 

is $300,000. 

• Maximum amount of insurance 

available under the NFIP: 

Æ Maximum limit available for type 

of structure is $500,000 per building 
(non-residential building). 

Æ Insurable value of the equipment 

shed is $30,000. 

The minimum amount of insurance 

required by the Regulation for the 
equipment shed is $30,000. 

AMOUNT 6. Is flood insurance 

required for each building when the real 
estate security contains more than one 
building located in an SFHA in a 
participating community? If so, how 
much coverage is required? 

Yes. The lender must determine the 
amount of insurance required on each 
building and add these individual 
amounts together.84 The total amount of 
required flood insurance is the lesser of: 
• The outstanding principal balance 

of the loan(s); or 

• The maximum amount of insurance 

available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ The maximum limit available for 

the type of structures; or 

Æ The ‘‘insurable value’’ of the 

structures. 

The amount of total required flood 
insurance can be allocated among the 
secured buildings in varying amounts, 
but all buildings in an SFHA must be 

covered in accordance with the 
statutory requirement.85 

Example: Lender makes a loan in the 

principal amount of $150,000 secured 
by five non-residential buildings, only 
three of which are located in SFHAs 
within participating communities. 
• Outstanding loan principal is 

$150,000. 

• Maximum amount of insurance 

available under the NFIP. 

Æ Maximum limit available for the 

type of structure is $500,000 per 
building for non-residential buildings 
(or $1.5 million total); or 

Æ Insurable value ($100,000 for each 

non-residential building for which 
insurance is required, or $300,000 total). 
Amount of insurance required for the 

three buildings is $150,000. This 
amount of required flood insurance 
could be allocated among the three 
buildings in varying amounts, so long as 
each is covered in accordance with the 
statutory requirement. 

AMOUNT 7. If the insurable value of 

a building or mobile home securing a 
designated loan is less than the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
loan, must a lender require the borrower 
to obtain flood insurance up to the 
balance of the loan? 

No. The Regulation provides that the 

amount of flood insurance must be at 
least equal to the lesser of the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
designated loan or the maximum limit 
of coverage available for a particular 
type of property under the Act.86 The 
Regulation also provides that flood 
insurance coverage under the Act is 
limited to the building or mobile home 
and any personal property that secures 
a loan and not the land itself. 87 Since 
the NFIP policy does not cover land 
value, lenders determine the amount of 
insurance necessary based on the 
insurable value of the building. 

AMOUNT 8. Can a lender require 

more flood insurance than the 
minimum required by the Regulation? 

Yes. Lenders are permitted to require 

more than the minimum amount of 
flood insurance required by the 
Regulation, taking into consideration 
applicable State and Federal law and 
safe and sound banking practices, as 
appropriate. However, the borrower or 
lender may have to seek such coverage 

85 See 42 U.S.C. 4012a; 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 
CFR 208.25(c)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC);

outside the NFIP. Although a lender has 
the responsibility to tailor its own flood 
insurance policies and procedures to 
suit its business needs and protect its 
ongoing interest in the collateral, it 
should consider the extent of recovery 
allowed under the NFIP or a private 
policy for the type of property being 
insured to assist the borrower in 
avoiding paying for coverage that 
exceeds the amount the insured would 
recover in the event of a loss. 

AMOUNT 9. Can a lender allow the 

borrower to use the maximum 
deductible to reduce the cost of flood 
insurance? 

Yes. However, it may not be a sound 

business practice for a lender, as a 
matter of policy, to always allow the 
borrower to use the maximum 
deductible. A lender should determine 
the reasonableness of the deductible on 
a case-by-case basis, taking into account 
the risk that such a deductible would 
pose to the borrower and lender. A 
lender may not allow the borrower to 
use a deductible amount equal to the 
insurable value of the property to avoid 
the mandatory purchase requirement for 
flood insurance.88 

AMOUNT 10. Can a lender accept a 

blanket flood insurance policy or 
blanket multi-peril policy covering 
multiple buildings that includes a per- 
occurrence deductible, regardless of 
whether any single building covered by 
the policy has an insurable value lower 
than the amount of the deductible? 

Yes, a lender may accept a blanket 
flood insurance policy or blanket multi- 
peril policy covering multiple buildings 
that includes a per-occurrence 
deductible, regardless of whether any 
single building covered by the policy 
has an insurable value lower than the 
amount of the deductible. A blanket 
flood insurance policy or blanket multi- 
peril policy that includes a per- 
occurrence deductible provides 
coverage for each building covered by 
such a policy, regardless of whether any 
individual building covered under the 
policy has an insurable value that may 
be lower than the amount of the 
deductible. However, a lender may not 
allow the borrower to use a deductible 
amount equal to the aggregate insurable 
value of the property to avoid the 
mandatory purchase requirement. A 
lender should determine the 
reasonableness of the deductible on a 
case-by-case basis, taking into account 
the risk that such deductible would 
pose to the borrower and lender. See 
Q&A Amount 9. 

XI. Flood Insurance Requirements for 
Construction Loans (Construction) 

CONSTRUCTION 1. Is a loan secured 

only by land, which is located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act and that will be 
developed into buildable lot(s), a 
designated loan that requires flood 
insurance? 

No. A designated loan is a loan 

secured by a building or mobile home 
that is located or to be located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act.89 Any loan 
secured only by land that is located in 
an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available is not a designated loan since 
it is not secured by a building or mobile 
home. 

CONSTRUCTION 2. Is a loan secured 

or to be secured by a building in the 
course of construction that is located or 
to be located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act a 
designated loan? 

Yes. A lender must always make a 

flood determination prior to loan 
origination to determine whether a 
building to be constructed that is 
security for the loan is located or will 
be located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act.90 
If the building or mobile home is 
located or will be located in an SFHA, 
then the loan is a designated loan and 
the lender must provide the requisite 
notice to the borrower prior to loan 
origination.91 The lender must then 
comply with the mandatory purchase 
requirement under the Act and 
Regulation.92 

CONSTRUCTION 3. Is a building in 

the course of construction that is 
located in an SFHA in which flood 
insurance is available under the Act 
eligible for coverage under an NFIP 
policy? 

Yes. The NFIP will insure a building 
in the course of construction before it is 
walled and roofed using the NFIP- 
issued rates based on the construction 
designs and the intended use of the 
building. However, buildings in the 
course of construction that are not 
walled and roofed are not eligible for 
coverage when construction stops for 
more than 90 days and/or if the lowest

(Board); 12 CFR 339.2 (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA). 

90 12 CFR 22.6(a) (OCC): 12 CFR 208.25(f)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.6(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4940(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.6(a) (NCUA). 

91 12 CFR 22.9(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(i) (Board); 

12 CFR 339.9(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4955(a) (FCA); 
and 12 CFR 760.9(a) (NCUA). 

floor for rating purposes is below the 
Base Flood Elevation. The NFIP will not 
insure materials or supplies intended 
for use in such construction, alteration, 
or repair unless they are contained 
within an enclosed building on the 
premises or adjacent to the premises. 
(See NFIP Flood Insurance Manual; the 
NFIP Dwelling Form for an SFIP.) 

The NFIP Flood Insurance Manual 
defines ‘‘start of construction’’ in the 
case of new construction as ‘‘either the 
first placement of permanent 
construction of a building on site, such 
as the pouring of a slab or footing, the 
installation of piles, the construction of 
columns, or any work beyond the stage 
of excavation; or the placement of a 
manufactured (mobile) home on a 
foundation.’’ 

Although an NFIP policy may be 

purchased prior to the start of 
construction, as a practical matter, 
coverage under an NFIP policy is not 
effective until actual construction 
commences or when materials or 
supplies intended for use in such 
construction, alteration, or repair are 
contained in an enclosed building on 
the premises or adjacent to the 
premises. 

CONSTRUCTION 4. When must a 
lender require the purchase of flood 
insurance for a loan secured by a 
building in the course of construction 
that is located in an SFHA in which 
flood insurance is available? 

Under the Act, as implemented by the 

Regulation, a lender may not make, 
increase, extend, or renew any loan 
secured by a building or a mobile home, 
located or to be located in an SFHA in 
which flood insurance is available, 
unless the property is covered by 
adequate flood insurance for the term of 
the loan.93 The NFIP provides that 
lenders may comply with the mandatory 
purchase requirement for a loan secured 
by a building in the course of 
construction that is located in an SFHA 
by requiring borrowers to have a flood 
insurance policy in place at the time of 
loan origination. Such a policy is issued 
based upon the construction designs 
and intended use of the building. A 
borrower should obtain a provisional 
rating (available only if certain criteria 
are met) to enable the placement of 
coverage prior to receipt of the Elevation 
Certificate (EC). In accordance with the 
NFIP requirement, it is expected that an 
EC will be secured and a full-risk rating 
completed within 60 days of the policy 
effective date. Failure to obtain the EC 
could result in reduced coverage limits

at the time of a loss. (See NFIP Flood 
Insurance Manual.) 

Alternatively, a lender may allow a 
borrower to defer the purchase of flood 
insurance until either after a foundation 
slab has been poured and/or an 
Elevation Certificate has been issued or, 
if the building to be constructed will 
have its lowest floor below the Base 
Flood Elevation, when the building is 
walled and roofed. However, in order to 
comply with the Regulation,94 the 
lender must require the borrower to 
have flood insurance for the security 
property in place before the lender 
disburses funds to pay for building 
construction (except for funds to be 
used to pour the slab or perform 
preliminary site work, such as laying 
utilities, clearing brush, or the purchase 
and/or delivery of building materials). If 
the lender elects this approach and does 
not require the borrower to obtain flood 
insurance at loan origination, then it 
should have adequate internal controls 
in place at origination to ensure that the 
borrower obtains flood insurance no 
later than 30 days prior to disbursement 
of funds to the borrower in light of the 
NFIP 30-day waiting period 
requirement. (See NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual.) See also Q&A Construction 5. 
CONSTRUCTION 5. Does the NFIP 
30-day waiting period apply when the 
purchase of the flood insurance policy 
is deferred in connection with a 
construction loan? 

Yes. A 30-day waiting period will 
apply if a lender allows a borrower to 
delay the purchase of flood insurance in 
connection with a construction loan 
after making, increasing, renewing, or 
extending the loan. A borrower must 
apply for flood insurance on or before 
the closing date of a loan transaction for 
the NFIP 30-day waiting period to be 
waived. See NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual. See also Q&A Construction 4. 

CONSTRUCTION 6. If a lender allows 

a borrower to defer the purchase of 
flood insurance until either a 
foundation slab has been poured and/or 
an Elevation Certificate has been issued, 
or if the building to be constructed will 
have its lowest floor below Base Flood 
Elevation when the building is walled 
and roofed, when must the lender begin 
escrowing flood insurance premiums 
and fees? 

If the lender allows a borrower to 
defer the purchase of flood insurance 
until either the foundation slab has been 
poured and/or an Elevation Certificate 
has been issued, or if the building to be 
constructed will have its lowest floor 

below Base Flood Elevation when the 
building is walled and roofed, a lender 
must escrow flood insurance premiums 
and fees at the time of purchase of the 
flood insurance, unless one of the 
escrow exceptions applies.95 

XII. Flood Insurance Requirements for 
Residential Condominiums and CO– 
Ops (Condo and Co-Op) 

CONDO AND CO-OP 1. Are 

residential condominiums, including 
multi-story condominium complexes, 
subject to the statutory and regulatory 
requirements for flood insurance? 

Yes. The mandatory flood insurance 

purchase requirements under the Act 
and Regulation apply to loans secured 
by individual residential condominium 
units, including those located in multi- 
story condominium complexes, located 
in an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act.96 The 
mandatory purchase requirements also 
apply to loans secured by other 
residential condominium property, such 
as loans to a developer for construction 
of the condominium or loans to a 
condominium association. 

CONDO AND CO-OP 2. What is an 

NFIP Residential Condominium 
Building Association Policy (RCBAP)? 
The RCBAP is a master policy for 
residential condominiums issued by 
FEMA. A residential condominium 
building is defined as having 75 percent 
or more of the building’s floor area in 
residential use. It may be purchased 
only by condominium owners 
associations. The RCBAP covers both 
the common and individually owned 
building elements within the units, 
improvements within the units, and 
contents owned in common (if contents 
coverage is purchased). The maximum 
amount of building coverage that can be 
purchased under an RCBAP is either 
100 percent of the replacement cost 
value of the building, including 
amounts to repair or replace the 
foundation and its supporting 
structures, or the total number of units 
in the condominium building times 
$250,000, whichever is less. RCBAP 
coverage is available only for residential 
condominium buildings in Regular 
Program communities. 

CONDO AND CO-OP 3. What is the 
amount of flood insurance coverage that 
a lender must require with respect to 
residential condominium units, 
including those located in multi-story 

residential condominium complexes, to 
comply with the mandatory purchase 
requirements under the Act and the 
Regulation? 

To comply with the Regulation, the 
lender must ensure that the minimum 
amount of flood insurance covering the 
condominium unit is the lesser of: 

• The outstanding principal balance 

of the loan(s); or 

• The maximum amount of insurance 

available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ The maximum limit available for 
the residential condominium unit; or 

Æ The ‘‘insurable value’’ allocated to 

the residential condominium unit, 
which is the replacement cost value of 
the condominium building divided by 
the number of units.97 

FEMA requires agents to provide on 
the declarations page of the RCBAP the 
replacement cost value of the 
condominium building and the number 
of units. Lenders may rely on the 
replacement cost value and number of 
units on the RCBAP declarations page in 
determining insurable value unless they 
have reason to believe that such 
amounts clearly conflict with other 
available information. If there is a 
conflict, the lender should notify the 
borrower of the facts that cause the 
lender to believe there is a conflict. If 
the lender determines that the borrower 
is underinsured, it must require the 
purchase of supplemental coverage.98 
However, coverage under the 
supplemental policy may be limited 
depending on other coverage that may 
be applicable including the RCBAP 
insuring the condominium building and 
the terms and conditions of the policy. 
Assuming that the maximum amount 
of coverage available under the NFIP is 
less than the outstanding principal 
balance of the loan, the lender must 
require a borrower whose loan is 
secured by a residential condominium 
unit to either: 

• Ensure the condominium owners 

association has purchased an NFIP 
RCBAP covering either 100 percent of 
the insurable value (replacement cost) of 
the building, including amounts to 
repair or replace the foundation and its 
supporting structures, or the total 
number of units in the condominium 
building times $250,000, whichever is 
less; or 

• Obtain flood insurance coverage if 
there is no RCBAP, as explained in Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 4, or if the RCBAP

coverage is less than 100 percent of the 
replacement cost value of the building 
or the total number of units in the 
condominium building times $250,000, 
whichever is less, as explained in Q&A 
Condo and Co-Op 5. 

Example: Lender makes a loan in the 

principal amount of $300,000 secured 
by a condominium unit in a 50-unit 
condominium building, which is 
located in an SFHA within a 
participating community, with a 
replacement cost of $15 million and 
insured by an RCBAP with $12.5 
million of coverage. 

• Outstanding principal balance of 

loan is $300,000. 

• Maximum amount of coverage 
available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ Maximum limit available for the 

residential condominium unit is 
$250,000; or 

Æ Insurable value of the unit based on 

100 percent of the building’s 
replacement cost value ($15 million ÷ 
50 = $300,000). 

The lender does not need to require 

additional flood insurance since the 
RCBAP’s $250,000 per unit coverage 
($12.5 million ÷ 50 = $250,000) satisfies 
the Regulation’s mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirement. (This 
is the lesser of the outstanding principal 
balance ($300,000), the maximum 
coverage available under the NFIP 
($250,000), or the insurable value 
($300,000)). See NFIP Flood Insurance 
Manual. 

The requirement discussed in this 
Q&A applies to any loan that is made, 
increased, extended, or renewed after 
October 1, 2007. This requirement does 
not apply to any loans made prior to 
October 1, 2007, until a triggering event 
occurs (that is, the loan is refinanced, 
extended, increased, or renewed) in 
connection with the loan. Absent a new 
triggering event, loans made prior to 
October 1, 2007, will be considered 
compliant if the lender complied with 
the Agencies’ previous guidance that an 
RCBAP with 80 percent RCV coverage 
was sufficient. FEMA issued guidance 
effective October 1, 2007, requiring 
NFIP insurers to add the RCV of the 
condominium building and the number 
of units to the RCBAP declarations page 
of all new and renewed policies. 
CONDO AND CO-OP 4. For 

residential condominiums with no 
RCBAP coverage, what action must a 
lender take for an individual unit 
owner? 

If there is no RCBAP on the 

residential condominium building, then 
the lender must require the individual 
unit owner to obtain coverage in an 
amount sufficient to meet the 

requirements outlined in Q&A Condo 
and Co-Op 3.99 

Under the NFIP, a Dwelling Policy is 
available for condominium unit owners’ 
purchase when there is no or inadequate 
RCBAP coverage. 

Example: The lender makes a loan in 

the principal amount of $175,000 
secured by a residential condominium 
unit in a 50-unit residential 
condominium building, which is 
located in an SFHA within a 
participating community, with a 
replacement cost value of $10 million; 
however, there is no RCBAP. 

• Outstanding principal balance of 

loan is $175,000. 

• Maximum amount of coverage 
available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ Maximum limit available for the 

residential condominium unit is 
$250,000; or 

Æ Insurable value of the unit based on 

100 percent of the building’s 
replacement cost value ($10 million ÷ 
50 = $200,000). 

The lender must require the 

individual unit owner to purchase flood 
insurance coverage in the amount of at 
least $175,000, since there is no RCBAP, 
to satisfy the Regulation’s mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirement. 
(This is the lesser of the outstanding 
principal balance ($175,000), the 
maximum coverage available under the 
NFIP ($250,000), or the insurable value 
($200,000).) 

CONDO AND CO-OP 5. What action 

must a lender take if the RCBAP 
coverage is insufficient to meet the 
Regulation’s mandatory purchase 
requirements for a loan secured by an 
individual residential condominium 
unit? 

If the lender determines that flood 
insurance coverage purchased under the 
RCBAP is insufficient to meet the 
Regulation’s mandatory purchase 
requirements, then the lender should 
request that the individual unit owner 
ask the condominium association to 
obtain additional coverage that would 
be sufficient to meet the Regulation’s 
requirements. See Q&A Condo and Co- 
Op 3. If the condominium association 
does not obtain sufficient coverage, then 
the lender must require the individual 
unit owner to purchase supplemental 
coverage in an amount sufficient to meet 
the Regulation’s flood insurance 
requirements.100 The amount of 
supplemental coverage required to be 

99 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

100 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

purchased by the individual unit owner 
would be the difference between the 
RCBAP’s coverage allocated to that unit 
and the Regulation’s mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirements. See 
Q&A Condo and Co-Op 4. 

Example: Lender makes a loan in the 

principal amount of $300,000 secured 
by a condominium unit in a 50-unit 
condominium building, which is 
located in an SFHA within a 
participating community, with a 
replacement cost value of $10 million; 
however, the RCBAP is at 80 percent of 
replacement cost value ($8 million or 
$160,000 per unit). 

• Outstanding principal balance of 

loan is $300,000. 

• Maximum amount of coverage 
available under the NFIP, which is the 
lesser of: 

Æ Maximum limit available for the 

residential condominium unit 
($250,000); or 

Æ Insurable value of the unit based on 

100 percent of the building’s 
replacement value ($10 million ÷ 50 = 
$200,000). 

The lender must require the 
individual unit owner to purchase 
supplemental flood insurance coverage 
in the amount of $40,000 to satisfy the 
Regulation’s mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement of $200,000. (This 
is the lesser of the outstanding principal 
balance ($300,000), the maximum 
coverage available under the NFIP 
($250,000), or the insurable value 
($200,000).) The RCBAP fulfills only 
$160,000 of the Regulation’s flood 
insurance requirement. 

While the individual unit owner’s 

purchase of a separate policy that 
provides for adequate flood insurance 
coverage under the Regulation will 
satisfy the Regulation’s mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirements, the 
lender and the individual unit owner 
may still be exposed to additional risk 
of loss. Lenders are encouraged to 
apprise borrowers of this risk. For 
example, the NFIP Dwelling Policy 
provides individual unit owners with 
supplemental building coverage that is 
in excess to the RCBAP. The policies are 
coordinated such that the Dwelling 
Policy purchased by the unit owner 
responds to shortfalls on building 
coverage pertaining either to 
improvements owned by the insured 
unit owner or to assessments. However, 
the Dwelling Policy does not extend the 
RCBAP limits, nor does it enable the 
condominium association to fill in gaps 
in coverage.

association allows its existing RCBAP to 
lapse? 

If a lender determines at any time 

during the term of a designated loan that 
the loan is not covered by flood 
insurance or is covered by such 
insurance in an amount less than that 
required under the Act and the 
Regulation, the lender must notify the 
individual unit owner of the 
requirement to maintain flood insurance 
coverage sufficient to meet the 
Regulation’s mandatory 
requirements.101 The lender should 
encourage the individual unit owner to 
work with the condominium association 
to acquire a new RCBAP in an amount 
sufficient to meet the Regulation’s 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirement. See Q&A Condo and Co- 
Op 3. Failing that, the lender must 
require the individual unit owner to 
obtain a flood insurance policy in an 
amount sufficient to meet the 
Regulation’s mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement. See Q&As Condo 
and Co-Op 4 & 5. If the borrower/unit 
owner or the condominium association 
fails to purchase flood insurance 
sufficient to meet the Regulation’s 
mandatory requirements within 45 days 
of the lender’s notification to the 
individual unit owner of inadequate 
insurance coverage, the lender must 
force place the necessary flood 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf.102 

CONDO AND CO-OP 7. How does the 
RCBAP’s co-insurance penalty apply in 
the case of residential condominiums, 
including those located in multi-story 
condominium complexes? 

In the event the RCBAP’s coverage on 

a condominium building at the time of 
loss is less than 80 percent of either the 
building’s replacement cost or the 
maximum amount of insurance 
available for that building under the 
NFIP (whichever is less), then the loss 
payment, which is subject to a 
coinsurance penalty, is determined as 
follows (subject to all other relevant 
conditions in the policy, including 
those pertaining to valuation, 
adjustment, settlement, and payment of 
loss): 

A. Divide the actual amount of flood 
insurance carried on the condominium 
building at the time of loss by 80 
percent of either its replacement cost or 
the maximum amount of insurance 
available for the building under the 
NFIP, whichever is less. 

101 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

102 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

B. Multiply the amount of loss, before 

application of the deductible, by the 
figure determined in A above. 

C. Subtract the deductible from the 

figure determined in B above. 

The policy will pay the amount 
determined in C above, or the amount 
of insurance carried, whichever is less. 
Example 1: (Inadequate insurance 

amount to avoid penalty). 

Replacement value of the building: 

$250,000. 

80% of replacement value of the 

building: $200,000. 

Actual amount of insurance carried: 

$180,000. 

Amount of the loss: $150,000. 
Deductible: $500. 
Step A: 180,000 ÷ 200,000 = .90 
(90% of what should be carried to 

avoid coinsurance penalty) 

Step B: 150,000 × .90 = 135,000 
Step C: 135,000¥500 = 134,500 
The policy will pay no more than 
$134,500. The remaining $15,500 is not 
covered due to the co-insurance penalty 
($15,000) and application of the 
deductible ($500). 

Example 2: (Adequate insurance 

amount to avoid penalty). 

Replacement value of the building: 

$250,000. 

80% of replacement value of the 

building: $200,000. 

Actual amount of insurance carried: 

$200,000. 

Amount of the loss: $150,000. 
Deductible: $500. 
Step A: 200,000 ÷ 200,000 = 1.00 
(100% of what should be carried to 

avoid coinsurance penalty) 

Step B: 150,000 × 1.00 = 150,000 
Step C: 150,000¥500 = 149,500 
In this example there is no co- 

insurance penalty, because the actual 
amount of insurance carried meets the 
80 percent requirement to avoid the co- 
insurance penalty. The policy will pay 
no more than $149,500 ($150,000 
amount of loss minus the $500 
deductible). This example also assumes 
a $150,000 outstanding principal loan 
balance. 

CONDO AND CO-OP 8. What are the 

major factors involved with the 
individual unit owner’s NFIP Dwelling 
Policy’s coverage limitations with 
respect to the condominium 
association’s RCBAP coverage? 

The following examples demonstrate 

how the unit owner’s NFIP Dwelling 
Policy may cover in certain loss 
situations: 

Example 1: RCBAP 
If the unit owner purchases building 
coverage under the Dwelling Policy and 
if there is an RCBAP covering at least 80 
percent of the building replacement cost 
value, the loss assessment coverage 

under the Dwelling Policy will pay that 
part of a loss that exceeds 80 percent of 
the association’s building replacement 
cost allocated to that unit. 

The loss assessment coverage under 
the Dwelling Policy will not cover the 
association’s policy deductible 
purchased by the condominium 
association. 

If building elements within units have 
also been damaged, the Dwelling Policy 
pays to repair building elements after 
the RCBAP limits that apply to the unit 
have been exhausted. Coverage 
combinations cannot exceed the total 
limit of $250,000 per unit. 
Example 2: No RCBAP 
If the unit owner purchases building 
coverage under the Dwelling Policy and 
there is no RCBAP, the Dwelling Policy 
covers assessments against unit owners 
for damages to common areas up to the 
Dwelling Policy limit. 

However, if there is damage to the 

building elements of the unit (e.g., 
inside the individual unit) as well, the 
combined payment of unit building 
damages, which would apply first, and 
the loss assessment may not exceed the 
building coverage limit under the 
Dwelling Policy. 

CONDO AND CO-OP 9. What are the 

flood insurance requirements for a 
residential condominium unit or a non- 
residential condominium unit located in 
a non-residential condominium 
building? What are the flood insurance 
requirements for a non-residential 
condominium unit located in a 
residential condominium building? 

Coverage is not available under the 

NFIP for an individual residential 
condominium unit or a non-residential 
condominium unit located in a non- 
residential condominium building. 
NFIP coverage is also not available for 
a non-residential condominium unit 
located in a residential condominium 
building. Therefore, a loan secured by 
one of these types of units is not a 
designated loan under the Regulation, 
and the mandatory flood insurance 
requirement does not apply. The 
Agencies note, however, that contents 
coverage is available through the NFIP 
for these types of units. See NFIP Flood 
Insurance Manual. 

CONDO AND CO-OP 10. What flood 
insurance requirements apply to a loan 
secured by a share in a cooperative 
building that is located in an SFHA? 
It is important to recognize the 
difference between ownership of a 
condominium and a cooperative. 
Although an owner of a condominium 
owns title to real property, a cooperative 
unit holder holds stock in a corporation 
with the right to occupy a particular 
unit, but owns no title to the building.

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

As a result, a loan to a cooperative unit 
owner, secured by the owner’s share in 
the cooperative, is not a designated loan 
that is subject to the Act or the 
Regulation. 

Although there is no requirement 

under the Act or Regulation to purchase 
flood insurance on the cooperative 
building if the loan is secured by the 
unit owner’s share in the cooperative, 
for safety and soundness purposes, 
residential or non-residential 
cooperative buildings may be insured by 
the association or corporation under the 
General Property Form. The entity that 
owns the cooperative building, not the 
individual unit members, is the named 
insured. 

XIII. Flood Insurance Requirements for 
Home Equity Loans, Lines of Credit, 
Subordinate Liens, and Other Security 
Interests in Collateral (Contents) 
Located in an SFHA (Other Security 
Interests) 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 1. Is 

a home equity loan considered a 
designated loan that requires flood 
insurance? 

Yes. A home equity loan is a 

designated loan, regardless of the lien 
priority, if the loan is secured by a 
building or a mobile home located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act.103 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 2. 
Does a draw against an approved line of 
credit secured by a building or mobile 
home, which is located in an SFHA in 
which flood insurance is available 
under the Act, require a flood 
determination under the Regulation? 

No. While a line of credit secured by 
a building or mobile home located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act is a designated 
loan and, therefore, requires a flood 
determination before the loan is made, 
draws against an approved line do not 
require further determinations.104 
However, a request made for an increase 
in an approved line of credit may 
require a new determination, depending 
upon whether a previous determination 
was done. See Q&A SFHDF 4. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 3. 
What is the amount of flood insurance 
coverage required on a line of credit 
secured by a residential improved real 
estate? 

A lender may take the following 

alternative approaches: 

103 12 CFR 22.2(e) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(b)(5) 
(Board); 12 CFR 339.2 (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA). 

104 12 CFR 22.2(e) and 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 
208.25(b)(5) and (c)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.2 and 
339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 and 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 and 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

• For administrative convenience in 

complying with the flood insurance 
requirements, upon origination, a lender 
may require the purchase of flood 
insurance for the total amount of all 
loans or the maximum amount of flood 
insurance coverage available, whichever 
is less; 105 or 

• A lender may actively review its 

records throughout the year to 
determine whether the appropriate 
amount of flood insurance coverage is 
maintained, considering the draws 
made against the line or repayments 
made to the account. In those instances 
in which there is no policy on the 
collateral at time of origination, the 
borrower must, at a minimum, obtain a 
policy as a requirement for drawing on 
the line. Lenders that choose to actively 
review the line should inform the 
borrower that this option may have 
more risks, such as inadequate flood 
insurance coverage during the 30-day 
waiting period for an NFIP flood policy 
to become effective. Lenders should be 
prepared to initiate force placement 
procedures if at any time the lender 
determines a lack of adequate flood 
insurance coverage for a designated line 
of credit, as required under the 
Regulation.106 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 4. 

When a lender makes, increases, 
extends or renews a second mortgage 
secured by a building or mobile home 
located in an SFHA, how much flood 
insurance must the lender require? 

The lender must ensure that adequate 

flood insurance is in place or require 
that additional flood insurance coverage 
be added to the flood insurance policy 
in the amount of the lesser of either the 
combined total outstanding principal 
balance of the first and second loan, the 
maximum amount available under the 
Act (currently $250,000 for most 
residential buildings and $500,000 for 
other buildings), or the insurable value 
of the building or mobile home.107 The 
junior lienholder should also have the 
borrower add the junior lienholder’s 
name as mortgagee/loss payee to the 
existing flood insurance policy. Given 
the provisions of NFIP policies, a lender 
cannot comply with the Act and 
Regulation by requiring the purchase of 
an NFIP flood insurance policy only in 
the amount of the outstanding principal 
balance of the second mortgage without 

105 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

106 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

107 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

regard to the amount of flood insurance 
coverage on a first mortgage. 

A junior lienholder should work with 

the senior lienholder, the borrower, or 
with both of these parties, to determine 
how much flood insurance is needed to 
cover improved real estate collateral. A 
junior lienholder should obtain the 
borrower’s consent in the loan 
agreement or otherwise for the junior 
lienholder to obtain information on 
balance and existing flood insurance 
coverage on senior lien loans from the 
senior lienholder. 

Junior lienholders also have the 
option of pulling a borrower’s credit 
report and using the information from 
that document to establish how much 
flood insurance is necessary upon 
increasing, extending, or renewing a 
junior lien, thus protecting the interests 
of the junior lienholder, the senior 
lienholder(s), and the borrower. In the 
limited situation in which a junior 
lienholder or its servicer is unable to 
obtain the necessary information about 
the amount of flood insurance in place 
on the outstanding balance of a senior 
lien (for example, in the context of a 
loan renewal), the lender may presume 
that the amount of insurance coverage 
relating to the senior lien in place at the 
time the junior lien was first established 
(provided that the amount of flood 
insurance relating to the senior lien was 
adequate at the time) continues to be 
sufficient. 

Example 1: Lender A makes a first 
mortgage with a principal balance of 
$100,000, but improperly requires only 
$75,000 of flood insurance coverage, 
which the borrower satisfied by 
obtaining an NFIP policy. Lender B 
issues a second mortgage with a 
principal balance of $50,000. The 
insurable value of the residential 
building securing the loans is $200,000. 
Lender B must ensure that flood 
insurance in the amount of $150,000 is 
purchased and maintained. If Lender B 
were to require additional flood 
insurance only in an amount equal to 
the principal balance of the second 
mortgage ($50,000), its interest in the 
secured property would not be fully 
protected in the event of a flood loss 
because Lender A would have prior 
claim on $100,000 of the loss payment 
towards its principal balance of 
$100,000, while Lender B would receive 
only $25,000 of the loss payment toward 
its principal balance of $50,000. 

Example 2: Lender A, who is not 

directly covered by the Act or 
Regulation, makes a first mortgage with 
a principal balance of $100,000 and 
does not require flood insurance. Lender 
B, who is directly covered by the Act 
and Regulation, issues a second

mortgage with a principal balance of 
$50,000. The insurable value of the 
residential building securing the loans 
is $200,000. Lender B must ensure that 
flood insurance in the amount of 
$150,000 is purchased and maintained. 
If Lender B were to require flood 
insurance only in an amount equal to 
the principal balance of the second 
mortgage ($50,000) through an NFIP 
policy, then its interest in the secured 
property would not be protected in the 
event of a flood loss because Lender A 
would have prior claim on the entire 
$50,000 loss payment towards its 
principal balance of $100,000. 

Example 3: Lender A made a first 
mortgage with a principal balance of 
$100,000 on improved real estate with 
a fair market value of $150,000. The 
insurable value of the residential 
building on the improved real estate is 
$90,000; however, Lender A improperly 
required only $70,000 of flood 
insurance coverage, which the borrower 
satisfied by purchasing an NFIP policy. 
Lender B later takes a second mortgage 
on the property with a principal balance 
of $10,000. Lender B must ensure that 
flood insurance in the amount of 
$90,000 (the insurable value) is 
purchased and maintained on the 
secured property to comply with the Act 
and Regulation. If Lender B were to 
require flood insurance only in an 
amount equal to the principal balance of 
the second mortgage ($10,000), its 
interest in the secured property would 
not be protected in the event of a flood 
loss because Lender A would have prior 
claim on the entire $80,000 loss 
payment towards the insurable value of 
$90,000. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 5. If a 
borrower requesting a loan secured by a 
junior lien provides evidence that flood 
insurance coverage is in place, does the 
lender have to make a new 
determination? Does the lender have to 
adjust the insurance coverage? 
It depends. Assuming the 

requirements in Section 528 of the Act 
(42 U.S.C. 4104b) are met and the same 
lender made the first mortgage, then a 
new determination may not be 
necessary when the existing 
determination is not more than seven 
years old, there have been no map 
changes, and the determination was 
recorded on an SFHDF. If, however, a 
lender other than the one that made the 
first mortgage loan is making the junior 
lien loan, a new determination would be 
required because this lender would be 
deemed to be ‘‘making’’ a new loan.108 

In either situation, the lender will need 
to determine whether the amount of 
insurance in effect is sufficient to cover 
the lesser of the combined outstanding 
principal balance of all loans (including 
the junior lien loan), the insurable 
value, or the maximum amount of 
coverage available on the improved real 
estate. This will hold true whether the 
subordinate lien loan is a home equity 
loan or some other type of junior lien 
loan. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 6. If 
the loan request is to finance inventory 
stored in a building located within an 
SFHA, but the building is not security 
for the loan, is flood insurance required? 

No. The Act and the Regulation 
provide that a lender shall not make, 
increase, extend, or renew a designated 
loan, that is, a loan secured by a 
building or mobile home located or to 
be located in an SFHA, ‘‘unless the 
building or mobile home and any 
personal property securing the loan is 
covered by flood insurance for the term 
of the loan.’’ 109 In this example, the 
loan is not a designated loan because it 
is not secured by a building or mobile 
home; rather, the collateral is the 
inventory alone. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 7. Is 

flood insurance required if a building 
and its contents both secure a loan, and 
the building is located in an SFHA in 
which flood insurance is available? 

Yes. Flood insurance is required for 
the building located in the SFHA and 
any personal property securing the 
loan.110 The method for allocating flood 
insurance coverage among multiple 
buildings, as described in Q&A Amount 
6, would be the same method for 
allocating flood insurance coverage 
among contents and buildings. That is, 
both contents and building will be 
considered to have a sufficient amount 
of flood insurance coverage for 
regulatory purposes so long as some 
reasonable amount of insurance is 
allocated to each category. 

Example: Lender A makes a loan for 
$200,000 that is secured by a warehouse 
with an insurable value of $150,000 and 
inventory in the warehouse worth 
$100,000. The Act and Regulation 
require that flood insurance coverage be 
obtained for the lesser of the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
loan or the maximum amount of flood 
insurance that is available under the 

339.6(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a), 614.4940(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a), 760.6(a) (NCUA). 

109 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

NFIP. The maximum amount of 
insurance that is available for both 
building and contents is $500,000 for 
each category. In this situation, Federal 
flood insurance requirements could be 
satisfied by placing $150,000 worth of 
flood insurance coverage on the 
warehouse, thus insuring it to its 
insurable value, and $50,000 worth of 
contents flood insurance coverage on 
the inventory, thus providing total 
coverage in the amount of the 
outstanding principal balance of the 
loan. Note that this holds true even 
though the inventory is worth $100,000. 
OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 8. If a 

loan is secured by Building A, which is 
located in an SFHA, and contents 
located in Building B where building B 
does not secure the loan, is flood 
insurance required on the contents 
securing the loan? 

No. If collateral securing the loan is 
stored in Building B, where Building B 
does not secure the loan, then flood 
insurance is not required on those 
contents whether or not Building B is 
located in an SFHA. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 9. 
Does the Regulation apply when the 
lender takes a security interest in 
improved real estate and contents 
located in an SFHA only as an 
‘‘abundance of caution’’? 

Yes. The Act and Regulation look to 
the collateral securing the loan. If the 
lender takes a security interest in 
improved real estate and contents 
located in an SFHA, then flood 
insurance is required.111 

The language in the loan agreement or 
security instrument determines whether 
the improved real estate and contents 
are taken as security for the loan. If a 
lender intends to take a security interest 
in the improved real estate and 
contents, the loan agreement or security 
instrument should include language 
indicating that the improved real estate 
and contents are security for the loan. If 
the lender does not intend to take a 
security interest in either the improved 
real estate and/or contents, the loan 
agreement or security instrument should 
not include language to this effect, 
including language inserted out of an 
‘‘abundance of caution.’’ 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 10. Is 

flood insurance required if the lender 
takes a security interest in contents 
located in a building in an SFHA 
securing the loan but does not perfect 
the security interest? 

Yes, flood insurance is required. The 

language in the loan agreement or

security instrument determines whether 
the contents are taken as security for the 
loan. If the lender takes a security 
interest in contents located in a building 
in an SFHA securing the loan, flood 
insurance is required for the contents, 
regardless of whether that security 
interest is perfected.112 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 11. If 

a borrower offers a note on a single- 
family dwelling as collateral for a loan 
but the lender does not take a security 
interest in the dwelling itself, is this a 
designated loan that requires flood 
insurance? 

No. A designated loan is a loan 

secured by a building or mobile home 
that is located or to be located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act.113 In this 
example, the lender did not take a 
security interest in the building; 
therefore, the loan is not a designated 
loan. 

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS 12. If 

a lender makes a loan that is not 
secured by real estate, but is made on 
the condition of a personal guarantee by 
a third party who gives the lender a 
security interest in improved real estate 
owned by the third party that is located 
in an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available, is it a designated loan that 
requires flood insurance? 

Yes. In this scenario, a loan is made 
on condition of a personal guarantee by 
a third party and further secured by 
improved real estate, which is located in 
an SFHA and owned by that third party. 
Under these circumstances, the security 
of improved real estate in an SFHA is 
so closely tied to the making of the loan 
that it is considered a designated loan 
that requires flood insurance.114 

XIV. Requirement To Escrow Flood 
Insurance Premiums and Fees— 
General (Escrow) 

ESCROW 1. When must escrow 
accounts be established for flood 
insurance purposes? 

A lender, or a servicer acting on its 
behalf, must escrow all premiums and 
fees for any flood insurance required 
under the mandatory purchase of flood 
insurance requirement for any 
designated loan secured by residential 
improved real estate or a mobile home 
that is made, increased, extended, or 
renewed on or after January 1, 2016. The 

escrow must be payable with the same 
frequency as payments on the 
designated loan are required to be made 
for the duration of the loan, unless the 
loan or lender is subject to one of the 
exceptions.115 

A lender is not required to escrow for 

flood insurance if it qualifies for the 
small lender exception 116 or the loan 
qualifies for one of the following loan- 
related exceptions 117 in the Regulation: 
• A loan that is an extension of credit 

primarily for business, commercial, or 
agricultural purposes; 

• A loan that is in a subordinate 
position to a senior lien secured by the 
same property for which the borrower 
has obtained adequate flood insurance 
coverage; 

• A loan that is covered by a 

condominium association, cooperative, 
homeowners association or other 
applicable group’s adequate flood 
insurance policy; 

• A loan that is a home equity line of 

credit; 

• A loan that is a nonperforming loan 

that is 90 or more days past due; or 

• A loan that has a term not longer 

than 12 months. 

If a lender no longer qualifies for the 
small lender exception, it must escrow 
all premiums and fees for any flood 
insurance required under the mandatory 
purchase of flood insurance requirement 
for any designated loan secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home that is made, increased, 
extended, or renewed on or after July 1 
of the first calendar year in which a 
lender has a change in status, unless a 
loan qualifies for another exception.118 
If a lender, other than a lender that 
qualifies for the small lender exception, 
determines at any time during the term 
of a designated loan secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home that an exception from the 
escrow requirement that previously 
applied to a particular loan no longer 
applies to the loan, the lender must 
escrow flood insurance premiums and 
fees as soon as reasonably 
practicable.119 

ESCROW 2. If a lender does not 

escrow for taxes or homeowner’s 
insurance, is it required to escrow for 
flood insurance under the Regulation? If 
yes, is the lender obligated to escrow for 
taxes and other insurance because it 
escrows for flood insurance pursuant to 
the rule? 

If a lender or its servicer is required 
to escrow for flood insurance under the 
Regulation, it must do so even if it does 
not escrow for taxes or other 
insurance.120 A lender or servicer is not, 
however, obligated to escrow for taxes 
and other insurance solely because it 
must escrow for flood insurance 
pursuant to the Regulation, though there 
may be other laws or regulations that 
require that additional escrow. 

ESCROW 3. Are lenders required to 

escrow force-placed insurance? 

Yes, the Regulation requires lenders 

or their servicers to escrow flood 
insurance premiums for any residential 
designated loan made, increased, 
extended, or renewed on or after 
January 1, 2016, unless the lender or the 
loan qualifies for an exception from the 
escrow requirement.121 The Act and 
Regulation do not include an exception 
to the escrow requirement for force- 
placed insurance. 

ESCROW 4. Does the requirement to 
escrow flood insurance premiums and 
fees apply when a loan does not 
experience a triggering event? 

No, subject to certain exceptions. The 
Regulation provides that a lender or its 
servicer is required to escrow flood 
insurance premiums and fees when a 
designated loan is made, increased, 
extended, or renewed (a triggering 
event), unless either the lender or the 
loan is excepted from the escrow 
requirement.122 Until the loan 
experiences a triggering event, the 
lender is not required to escrow flood 
insurance premiums and fees, unless: (i) 
A borrower requests the escrow in 
connection with the requirement that 
the lender provide an option to escrow 
for outstanding loans; 123 or (ii) the 
lender determines that a loan exception

to the escrow requirement no longer 
applies.124 

ESCROW 5. Are multi-family 
buildings or mixed-use properties 
included in the definition of ‘‘residential 
improved real estate’’ under the 
Regulation for which escrows are 
required (unless an exception applies)? 
Yes. For the purposes of the Act and 

the Regulation, the definition of 
residential improved real estate does not 
make a distinction between whether a 
building is single- or multi-family, or 
whether a building is owner- or renter- 
occupied.125 Single-family dwellings 
(including mobile homes), two-to-four 
family dwellings, and multi-family 
properties containing five or more 
residential units are considered 
residential improved real estate. 

However, with regard to mixed-use 
properties, the lender should look to the 
primary use of a building to determine 
whether it meets the definition of 
‘‘residential improved real estate.’’ See 
Q&As Amount 3 and 4 for guidance on 
residential and non-residential 
buildings. A loan secured by residential 
improved real estate is not subject to the 
escrow requirement if the loan is an 
extension of credit primarily for 
business, commercial or agricultural 
purposes.126 

ESCROW 6. If a borrower obtains a 
second mortgage loan for a property 
located in an SFHA, and it is 
determined that the first lienholder does 
not have sufficient flood insurance 
coverage for both liens and is not 
currently escrowing for flood insurance, 
does the junior lienholder have to 
escrow for the additional amount of 
flood insurance coverage? 

Under the Regulation, for a closed- 

end second mortgage loan, junior 
lienholders are not required to escrow 
for flood insurance as long as the 
borrower has obtained flood insurance 
coverage that meets the mandatory 
purchase requirement. Thus, the junior 
lender or its servicer must ensure that 
adequate flood insurance is in place. 
See Q&A Other Security Interests 4 for 
junior lienholder requirements.127 Q&A 
Other Security Interests 4 explains the 

requirements for junior lienholders. If 
adequate flood insurance has not been 
obtained by the first lienholder and 
insurance must be purchased in 
connection with the second mortgage 
loan to meet the mandatory purchase 
requirement, the junior lender or its 
servicer would need to escrow the 
insurance obtained in connection with 
the second mortgage loan.128 However, 
the escrow requirements do not apply to 
a junior lien that is a home equity line 
of credit (HELOC) since HELOCs have a 
separate escrow exception under the Act 
and Regulation.129 

ESCROW 7. Does a lender or servicer 

have to escrow for loans when the 
security property is not located in an 
SFHA, but the borrower chooses to buy 
flood insurance? 

Under the Regulation, lenders and 
servicers are only required to escrow for 
loans that are secured by residential 
improved real estate or a mobile home 
located or to be located in SFHAs where 
flood insurance is available under the 
NFIP and that experience a triggering 
event (made, increased, extended, or 
renewed) on or after January 1, 2016, 
unless either the lender or the loan 
qualifies for an exception.130 If the 
property securing the loan is not located 
in an SFHA, it is not a designated loan, 
and the lender or its servicer is not 
required to escrow, although the lender 
or servicer may offer escrow service to 
the borrower. 

XV. Requirement To Escrow Flood 
Insurance Premiums and Fees—Escrow 
Small Lender Exception (Escrow Small 
Lender Exception) 

ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 1. Is the $1B small lender 
exception for the mandatory escrow of 
flood insurance premiums at the 
lending institution level or bank holding 
company level? 

By its own terms, the small lender 
exception to the flood insurance escrow 
requirement applies to lenders rather 
than holding companies.131 Therefore, 
the $1 billion requirement is calculated 
based on the assets held at the lending

(NCUA). 

institution level, rather than at the 
holding company level. 

ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 2. If a lender was required 
to escrow for taxes and hazard 
insurance solely under the (a) Higher- 
Priced Mortgage Loan (HPML) rules or 
(b) U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) or Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) programs on or 
before July 6, 2012, is such a lender, 
who otherwise qualifies for the small 
lender exception, required to escrow the 
premiums and fees for flood insurance? 
The Act and Regulation provide that 

a small lender is eligible for the 
exception only if, on or before July 6, 
2012, the lender: (1) was not required 
under Federal or State law to deposit 
taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any 
other charges in an escrow account for 
the entire term of any loan secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home; and (2) did not have a 
policy of consistently and uniformly 
requiring the deposit of taxes, insurance 
premiums, fees, or other charges in an 
escrow account for any loans secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home.132 

• With respect to an HPML, Federal 
law in effect on or before July 6, 2012, 
permitted a borrower to request 
cancellation of the escrow rather than 
have it apply for the entire term of the 
loan. Therefore, HPML escrow 
requirements would not result in the 
loss of the escrow exception for a small 
lender that made an HPML-covered loan 
prior to July 6, 2012, because the lender 
was not required under Federal law to 
escrow for the entire term of the loan. 
Note that the phrase ‘‘entire term’’ 
applies only with respect to the Federal 
or State law requirements criterion of 
the exception. In addition, if a lender 
required escrow for an HPML solely to 
comply with Federal law, a lender 
complying with that law would not be 
considered to have its own separate 
policy of consistently and uniformly 
requiring escrow. 

• With respect to loans under the 
USDA or FHA programs, under Federal 
law, such loans require the deposit of 
taxes, insurance premiums, fees and 
other charges in an escrow account for 
the entire term of the loan. Therefore, 
the first criterion of the exception would 
not be met and would disqualify the 
lender from the small lender exception 
under the Act and the Regulation.

if it is required to collect escrowed funds 
on a mortgage loan on behalf of a third 
party? 

To qualify for the small lender 

exception, one requirement is the lender 
must not have had a policy on or before 
July 6, 2012, of consistently and 
uniformly requiring the deposit of taxes, 
insurance premiums, fees, or any other 
charges in an escrow account for any 
loans secured by residential improved 
real estate or a mobile home.133 

• With regard to mortgage loans for 

which the lender had a policy on or 
before July 6, 2012, of collecting escrow 
funds at closing and the lender 
maintained servicing of the loan, the 
lender would not qualify for the 
exception because the lender 
established an individual escrow 
account for the loan it would then 
service. 

• With regard to mortgage loans for 
which the lender did not have a policy 
on or before July 6, 2012, of collecting 
the escrow funds on its own behalf at 
closing, but escrowed funds on behalf of 
a third party and then transferred those 
escrow funds to the third party servicing 
that loan, the lender would be able to 
qualify for the small lender exception 
provided the lender did not establish an 
individual escrow account and the 
lender transferred the funds to the third 
party as soon as reasonably practicable. 
The small lender must also satisfy the 
other requirements for the exception, 
but because no individual escrow 
account was established for the loan 
whose servicing rights were transferred 
pursuant to a third party’s requirements, 
the lender would not have had a policy 
of consistently and uniformly requiring 
the deposit of funds in an escrow 
account. 

ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 4. Is a lender eligible for 
the small lender exception if, on or 
before July 6, 2012, it offered escrow 
accounts only upon a borrower’s 
request? 

Yes. If, on or before July 6, 2012, a 
lender offered escrow accounts only 
upon the request of borrowers, this 
practice did not constitute a consistent 
or uniform policy of requiring escrow 
and the lender is eligible for the 
exception, provided all other conditions 
for the exception are met. The small 
lender exception does not apply if, on 
or before July 6, 2012, the lender had a 
policy of consistently and uniformly 
requiring the deposit of taxes, insurance

339.5(c)(1)(ii)(B) (FDIC); 12 CFR

premiums, fees, or any other charges in 
an escrow account for a loan secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home.134 

ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 5. Is the option to escrow 
notice required for all outstanding loans 
secured by residential real estate that 
are not excepted from the escrow 
requirement? What about outstanding 
loans that are not secured by buildings 
located in SFHAs? 

Under the Regulation, lenders or their 
servicers are required to offer and make 
available the option to escrow flood 
insurance premiums and fees for all 
outstanding designated loans secured by 
residential improved real estate or a 
mobile home located in an SFHA as of 
January 1, 2016, or July 1 of the first 
calendar year in which the lender no 
longer qualifies for the small lender 
exception to the escrow requirement.135 
With the expiration of the June 30, 2016, 
deadline to comply with the option to 
escrow notice requirement for 
outstanding loans as of January 1, 2016, 
that requirement currently applies only 
to lenders who have a change in status 
and no longer qualify for the small 
lender exception.136 Such lenders will 
be required to provide the option to 
escrow notice by September 30 of the 
first calendar year in which the lender 
has had a change in status pursuant to 
the Regulation.137 The requirement to 
provide the option to escrow notice 
does not apply to outstanding loans or 
to lenders that are excepted from the 
general escrow requirement under the 
Regulation. The option to escrow notice 
requirement also does not apply to loans 
that are not subject to the mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirement. 

ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 6. If the borrower has 
waived escrow of flood insurance 
premiums and fees, does the lender or 
its servicer still need to send a notice to 
offer the ability to escrow for the flood 
insurance? 

Yes, if the small lender exception no 
longer applies. See Q&A Escrow Small 
Lender Exception 5. The Regulation 

134 12 CFR 22.5(c)(1)(ii)(B) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(e)(3)(i)(B)(2) (Board); 12 CFR 
339.5(c)(1)(ii)(B) (FDIC); 12 CFR 
614.4935(c)(1)(ii)(B) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.5(c)(1)(ii)(B) (NCUA). 

does not exclude loans for which 
borrowers have previously waived 
escrow from the requirement to offer 
and make available the option to escrow 
flood insurance premiums and fees. 
Consequently, lenders or their servicers 
must send a notice of the option to 
escrow flood insurance premiums and 
fees to borrowers who have previously 
waived escrow or for whom lenders 
previously offered an option to 
escrow.138 Although a borrower may 
have previously decided to waive 
escrow or been offered an option to 
escrow, it is possible that the borrower’s 
circumstances have changed, and if 
offered another chance to escrow, the 
borrower may desire to do so. 
ESCROW SMALL LENDER 

EXCEPTION 7. Is it correct that lenders 
that qualify for the small lender 
exception are not required to provide 
borrowers the escrow notice or the 
option to escrow notice? 

Yes. Lenders that qualify for the small 

lender exception are not required to 
provide borrowers either the escrow 
notice or the option to escrow notice 
unless the lender ceases to qualify for 
the small lender exception.139 

XVI. Requirement To Escrow Flood 
Insurance Premiums and Fees—Escrow 
Loan Exceptions (Escrow Loan 
Exceptions) 

ESCROW LOAN EXCEPTIONS 1. Are 

escrow accounts for flood insurance 
premiums and fees required for 
commercial loans that are secured by 
residential property? 

No. Extensions of credit primarily for 

business, commercial or agricultural 
purposes are not subject to the escrow 
requirement for flood insurance 
premiums and fees, even if such loans 
are secured by residential improved real 
estate or a mobile home.140 See Q&A 
Exemptions 1 for further information on 
the definition of residential property. 

ESCROW LOAN EXCEPTIONS 2. Are 

escrow accounts for flood insurance 
premiums and fees required for loans 
secured by particular units located in 
multi-family buildings? 

The escrow requirements in the 
Regulation would not apply to a loan 
secured by a particular unit in a multi- 
family residential building if a

condominium association, cooperative, 
homeowners association, or other 
applicable group provides an adequate 
policy and pays for the insurance as a 
common expense.141 See Q&A 
Exemptions 1. Otherwise, the escrow 
requirements generally would apply to 
loans for particular units in multi-family 
residential buildings. 

ESCROW LOAN EXCEPTIONS 3. 
Which requirements for an escrow 
account apply to a property covered by 
an RCBAP? 

An RCBAP (Residential 

Condominium Building Association 
Policy) is a policy purchased by the 
condominium association on behalf of 
itself and the individual unit owners in 
the condominium. Typically, a portion 
of the periodic dues paid to the 
association by the condominium owners 
applies to the premiums on the policy. 
When a lender makes, increases, 
renews, or extends a loan secured by a 
condominium unit that is adequately 
covered by an RCBAP and RCBAP 
premiums are paid by the condominium 
association as a common expense, an 
escrow account is not required.142 
However, if the RCBAP coverage is 
inadequate and the unit is also covered 
by a flood insurance policy for 
supplemental coverage, premiums for 
the supplemental policy would need to 
be escrowed, provided the lender or the 
loan did not qualify for any other 
exception from the Regulation’s escrow 
requirement.143 Lenders should exercise 
due diligence with respect to continuing 
compliance with the insurance 
requirements on the part of the 
condominium association. 

ESCROW LOAN EXCEPTIONS 4. Do 
construction-permanent loans qualify 
for the 12-month exception if one phase 
of the loan is for 12 months or less? 

Generally, no. Construction- 

permanent loans (or C–P loans) are 
loans that have a construction phase of 
approximately one year before the loan 
converts into permanent financing. 
During the construction phase, the loan 
is typically interest-only, so the 
borrower does not start paying principal 
until the permanent phase. After the 
construction phase, the borrower 
generally comes in to sign papers to 
start the permanent phase, but this is 
not a true closing. Given that C–P loans

208.25(e)(1)(ii)(C) (Board); 12 CFR 339.5(a)(2)(iii) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4935(a)(2)(iii) (FCA); and 12 
CFR 760.5(a)(2)(iii) (NCUA). 

142 12 CFR 22.5(a)(2)(iii) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(e)(1)(ii)(C) (Board); 12 CFR 339.5(a)(2)(iii) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4935(a)(2)(iii) (FCA); and 12 
CFR 760.5(a)(2)(iii) (NCUA). 

are generally 20- to 30-year term loans, 
a C–P loan would not qualify for the 12 
month-exception from escrow, even if 
one phase of the loan is for 12 months 
or less. 

ESCROW LOAN EXCEPTIONS 5. 
Although a lender is not required to 
monitor whether a subordinate lien 
moves into first lien position for the 
purpose of the mandatory escrow 
requirement, if the lender becomes 
aware that the subordinate lien 
exception no longer applies, when must 
the lender begin to escrow? 

If at any time during the term of the 

loan a lender determines that a 
subordinate lien exception no longer 
applies, the lender must begin 
escrowing flood insurance premiums 
and fees as soon as reasonably 
practicable (unless another exception 
applies).144 Lenders should ensure that 
the loan documents for the subordinate 
lien permit the lender to require an 
escrow if the loan takes a first lien 
position. 

XVII. Force Placement Of Flood 
Insurance (Force Placement) 

FORCE PLACEMENT 1. What is the 
requirement for the force placement of 
flood insurance under the Act and the 
Regulation? 

When a lender makes a determination 

that the collateral securing the loan is 
uninsured or underinsured, it must 
begin the force placement process. 
Specifically, the Act and the Regulation 
provide that if a lender, or a servicer 
acting on its behalf, determines at any 
time during the term of a designated 
loan that a building or mobile home and 
any personal property securing the loan 
is not covered by flood insurance or is 
covered by flood insurance in an 
amount less than the amount required 
under the Regulation, the lender or its 
servicer must notify the borrower that 
the borrower must obtain flood 
insurance, at the borrower’s expense, in 
an amount at least equal to the 
minimum amount required under the 
Regulation. If the borrower fails to 
obtain flood insurance within 45 days of 
the lender’s notification to the borrower, 
the lender must purchase flood 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf at 
that time. The lender must force place 
flood insurance for the full amount 
required under the Regulation, or if the 
borrower has purchased flood insurance 
that otherwise satisfies the flood 
insurance requirements but in an 
insufficient amount, the lender would 

144 12 CFR 22.5(a)(3) (OCC); 12 CFR 

be required to force place only for the 
‘‘insufficient amount,’’ that is, the 
difference between the amount the 
borrower insured and the required 
amount of flood insurance. The Act and 
the Regulation also provide that the 
lender or its servicer may purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf and 
may charge the borrower for the cost of 
premiums and fees incurred in 
purchasing the insurance beginning on 
the date on which flood insurance 
coverage lapsed or did not provide a 
sufficient coverage amount. See also 
Q&A Force Placement 8.145 

A lender or its servicer may include 

in the force placement notice the 
amount of flood insurance needed. By 
providing this information, the lender or 
its servicer can help ensure that a 
borrower obtains the appropriate 
amount of insurance. In addition, before 
the lender or servicer must force place 
flood insurance, if the lender or servicer 
is aware that a borrower has obtained 
insurance that otherwise satisfies the 
flood insurance requirements but in an 
insufficient amount, the lender or 
servicer should inform the borrower an 
additional amount of insurance is 
needed in order to comply with the 
Regulation. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 2. When must a 

lender provide the force placement 
notice to the borrower? 

The Regulation requires the lender, or 

its servicer, to send notice to the 
borrower upon making a determination 
that the building or mobile home and 
any personal property securing the 
designated loan is not covered by flood 
insurance or is covered by flood 
insurance in an amount less than the 
amount required under the Regulation. 
The Agencies expect that such notice 
will be provided to the borrower at the 
time of determination of no or 
insufficient coverage. If there is a brief 
delay in providing the notice, the 
Agencies will expect the lender or 
servicer to provide a reasonable 
explanation for the delay. For example, 
there may be brief delays due to various 
lender processes, including but not 
limited to, batch processing and manual 
exception processing. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 3. May a 
servicer force place on behalf of a 
lender? 

Yes. Assuming the statutory 

prerequisites for force placement are 
met, and subject to the servicing 
contract between the lender and its 
servicer, the Act authorizes servicers to 
force place flood insurance on behalf of 

143 12 CFR 22.5(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(e)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.5(a)(1) (FDIC); 12 CFR 
614.4935(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.5(a)(1) (NCUA). 

208.25(e)(1)(iii) (Board); 12 CFR 339.5(a)(3) (FDIC); 
12 CFR 614.4935(a)(3) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.5(a)(3) (NCUA). 

145 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA).

the lender, following the procedures set 
forth in the Regulation.146 

more than 45 days for the borrower to 
obtain sufficient coverage? 

FORCE PLACEMENT 4. May a lender 
satisfy its notice requirement by sending 
the force placement notice to the 
borrower prior to the expiration of the 
flood insurance policy? 

No. The Act specifically provides that 

the lender or servicer for a loan must 
send a notice upon its determination 
that the collateral property securing the 
loan is either not covered by flood 
insurance or is covered by flood 
insurance in an amount less than the 
amount required.147 Although a lender 
may send notice prior to the expiration 
date of the flood insurance policy as a 
courtesy, the lender or servicer is still 
required to send notice upon 
determining that the flood insurance 
policy actually has lapsed or is 
insufficient in meeting the statutory 
requirement. The lender may purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf 
beginning on the date of the lapse.148 
FORCE PLACEMENT 5. When must 
the lender have flood insurance in place 
if the borrower has not obtained 
adequate insurance within 45 days after 
notification? 

The Regulation provides that the 
lender or its servicer shall purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf if the 
borrower fails to obtain flood insurance 
within 45 days after notification.149 If 
the borrower fails to obtain flood 
insurance and the lender does not force 
place flood insurance by the end of the 
force placement notification period, the 
Agencies will expect the lender to 
provide a reasonable explanation for the 
brief delay, for example, that a lender 
uses batch processing to purchase force- 
placed flood insurance policies. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 6. Once a lender 

makes a determination that a 
designated loan has no or insufficient 
flood insurance coverage and sends the 
borrower a force placement notice, may 
a lender make a subsequent 
determination in connection with the 
initial notification period that the 
designated loan has no or insufficient 
coverage and send another force 
placement notice, effectively providing 

146 42 U.S.C. 4012a(e); 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 
CFR 208.25(g)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 
12 CFR 614.4945(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) 
(NCUA). 

147 12 U.S.C. 4012a(e)(1). See also 12 CFR 22.7(a) 
(OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.7(a) (NCUA). 

148 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

No. The Act and Regulation state that 

once a lender makes a determination 
that a designated loan has no or 
insufficient flood insurance coverage, 
the lender must notify the borrower and, 
if the borrower fails to obtain sufficient 
flood insurance coverage within 45 days 
after that notice, the lender must 
purchase coverage on the borrower’s 
behalf.150 For example, if in response to 
a force placement notice, the borrower 
obtains flood insurance that is 
insufficient in amount, there is no 
extension of the time period by which 
the lender must force place flood 
insurance. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 7. May a lender 

commence a force-placed insurance 
policy on the day the previous policy 
expires, or must the new policy begin on 
the day after? 

The Regulation provides that the 
lender or its servicer may charge the 
borrower for the cost of premiums and 
fees incurred in purchasing the 
insurance, including premiums or fees 
incurred for coverage, beginning on the 
date on which flood insurance lapsed or 
did not provide a sufficient coverage 
amount.151 

A lender, however, may not require 
the borrower to pay for double coverage. 
The Regulation requires the lender or its 
servicer to refund to the borrower all 
premiums paid by the borrower for any 
force-placed insurance purchased by the 
lender or its servicer during any period 
in which the borrower’s flood insurance 
coverage and the force-placed insurance 
policy were each in effect.152 

For example, if the previous policy 
expires at 12:01 a.m., the lender’s new 
force-placed policy should not begin to 
provide coverage until 12:01 a.m. of the 
same day. If the lender did force place 
at a date and time that would result in 
the force-placed policy providing 
overlapping coverage, the lender should 
not charge the borrower for the period 
of overlapping coverage. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 8. When force 
placement occurs, what is the amount of 
insurance required to be placed? 
The Regulation states that the 

minimum amount of flood insurance 
required ‘‘must be at least equal to the 
lesser of the outstanding principal 

balance of the designated loan or the 
maximum limit of coverage available for 
the particular type of property under the 
Act.’’ 153 Therefore, if the outstanding 
principal balance is the basis for the 
minimum amount of required flood 
insurance, the lender must ensure that 
the force-placed policy amount covers 
the outstanding principal balance plus 
any additional force-placed premium 
and fees capitalized into the outstanding 
principal balance.154 

To illustrate this point, assume that 

there is a loan with an outstanding 
principal balance of $200,000, secured 
by a residential property located in an 
SFHA that has an insurable value of 
$350,000. The borrower has a $200,000 
flood insurance policy for that property, 
reflecting the minimum amount 
required under the Regulation. If the 
$200,000 flood insurance policy lapses, 
the lender or its servicer must notify the 
borrower of the need to obtain adequate 
flood insurance. If the borrower fails to 
obtain adequate flood insurance within 
45 days after notification, then the 
lender or its servicer must purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf.155 
If the lender intends to capitalize the 

premium for the force-placed policy 
into the outstanding principal balance, 
the lender must ensure that the policy 
is issued in an amount sufficient to 
cover the anticipated higher outstanding 
principal balance, including the force- 
placed policy premium, even if the 
capitalization of the force-placed 
premium is not considered a triggering 
event. See also Q&A Force Placement 
10. In this scenario, if the cost of the 
force-placed policy is $2,000, the 
coverage amount of the force-placed 
policy must be at least $202,000. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 9. When may a 

lender or its servicer charge the 
borrower for the cost of force-placed 
insurance? 

A lender, or a servicer acting on its 
behalf, may force place flood insurance 
and charge the borrower for the cost of 
premiums and fees incurred by the 
lender or servicer in purchasing the 
flood insurance on the borrower’s behalf 
at any time starting from the date on 
which flood insurance coverage lapsed 
or did not provide a sufficient coverage 
amount. The lender or servicer would 
not have to wait 45 days after providing

notification to force place insurance.156 
Lenders that monitor loans secured by 
property located in an SFHA for 
continuous flood insurance coverage 
can minimize any gaps in coverage and 
any charge to the borrower for coverage 
for a timeframe prior to the lender’s or 
its servicer’s date of discovery and force 
placement. If a lender or its servicer, 
despite its monitoring efforts, discovers 
a loan with no or insufficient coverage, 
for example, due to a remapping, it may 
charge the borrower for premiums and 
fees incurred by the lender or servicer 
for a force-placed flood insurance policy 
purchased on the borrower’s behalf, 
including premiums and fees for 
coverage, beginning on the date of no or 
insufficient coverage, provided that the 
policy was effective as of the date of the 
insufficient coverage. When a lender or 
its servicer purchases a policy on the 
borrower’s behalf, the lender or its 
servicer may not charge for premiums 
and fees for coverage beginning on the 
date of lapse or insufficient coverage if 
that policy purchased on the borrower’s 
behalf did not provide coverage for the 
borrower prior to purchase. A lender’s 
or servicer’s frequent need to purchase 
policies on a borrower’s behalf having 
coverage that precedes the date of 
purchase may, depending upon the facts 
and circumstances, indicate that there 
are weaknesses within the lender’s or 
servicer’s compliance management 
system. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 10. Does 
capitalizing the flood insurance 
premium into the outstanding principal 
balance constitute a triggering event— 
an ‘‘increase’’ that would trigger the 
applicability of flood insurance 
regulatory requirements? 

The Act and the Regulation require a 

lender to notify the borrower that the 
borrower should obtain adequate flood 
insurance when the lender determines 
that a building or a mobile home located 
or to be located in an SFHA is not 
covered by any or adequate flood 
insurance.157 If the borrower fails to 
obtain adequate flood insurance within 
45 days, then the lender must purchase 
insurance on the borrower’s behalf. The 
lender may charge the borrower for the 
premiums and fees incurred by the 
lender in purchasing the force-placed 
flood insurance.158 

156 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

157 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

158 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

Among the various methods that a 
lender might use to charge a borrower 
for force-placed flood insurance are: (1) 
Capitalizing the premium and fees into 
the outstanding principal balance; (2) 
adding the premium and fees to a 
separate account; (3) advancing funds 
from the escrow account to pay for the 
premiums and fees of the force-placed 
flood insurance; or (4) billing the 
borrower directly for the premiums and 
fees of the force-placed flood insurance 
policy. The treatment of force-placed 
flood insurance premiums and fees 
depends on the method the lender 
chooses for charging the borrower. 

Premium and Fees Capitalized Into 
Outstanding Principal Balance 

If the lender’s loan contract with the 

borrower includes a provision 
permitting the lender or servicer to 
advance funds to pay for flood 
insurance premiums and fees as 
additional debt to be secured by the 
building or mobile home, such an 
advancement would be considered part 
of the loan. As such, the capitalization 
of the flood insurance premiums and 
fees into the outstanding principal 
balance is not considered an ‘‘increase’’ 
in the loan amount, and thus would not 
be considered a triggering event. If, 
however, there is no explicit provision 
permitting this type of advancement of 
funds in the loan contract, the 
capitalization of flood insurance 
premiums and fees into the borrower’s 
outstanding principal balance would be 
considered an ‘‘increase’’ in the loan 
amount, and, therefore is considered a 
triggering event because no 
advancement of funds was 
contemplated as part of the loan. See 
also Q&A Force Placement 8. 

Premium and Fees Added to an Account 

If the lender accounts for and tracks 
the amount owed on the force-placed 
flood insurance premium and fees in a 
separate account, this approach does not 
result in an increase in the loan balance 
and, therefore, is not considered a 
triggering event. 

Premium and Fees Advanced From the 
Borrower’s Escrow Account 

If the lender’s loan contract with the 
borrower permits the lender to advance 
the premiums and fees for the force- 
placed flood insurance from the 
borrower’s escrow account, this 
approach does not increase the 
outstanding principal balance and is not 
considered a triggering event. 

Premium and Fees Billed Directly to 
Borrower 

If the lender bills the borrower 

directly for the cost of the force-placed 
flood insurance, this approach does not 
increase the outstanding principal 
balance and is not considered a 
triggering event. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 11. What 

documentation is sufficient to 
demonstrate evidence of flood insurance 
in connection with a lender’s refund of 
premiums paid by a borrower for force- 
placed insurance during any period of 
overlap with borrower-purchased 
insurance? 

With respect to when a lender is 
required to refund premiums paid by a 
borrower for force-placed insurance 
during any period of overlap with 
borrower-purchased insurance, the 
Regulation specifically addresses the 
documentation requirements. The 
Regulation provides that, for purposes 
of confirming a borrower’s existing 
flood insurance coverage, a lender must 
accept from the borrower an insurance 
policy declarations page that includes 
the existing flood insurance policy 
number and the identity of, and contact 
information for, the insurance company 
or its agent.159 The Regulation does not 
require that the declarations page 
contain any additional information in 
order to ascertain whether the policy 
meets the mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement to determine 
whether a refund is required. See Q&A 
Private Flood Compliance 5 for further 
guidance regarding evaluation under the 
private flood insurance requirements of 
the Regulation. 

In situations not involving a lender’s 

refund of premiums for force-placed 
insurance, the Regulation does not 
specify what documentation would be 
sufficient. Generally, it is appropriate, 
although not required by the Regulation, 
for lenders to accept a copy of the flood 
insurance application and premium 
payment as evidence of proof of 
purchase for new policies. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 12. If a lender 
receives a confirmation, consistent with 
the Regulation, of a borrower’s existing 
flood insurance coverage evidencing an 
overlap with a force-placed flood 
insurance policy, but the lender does 
not receive a refund from the insurance 
provider of the force-placed flood 
insurance policy in a timely manner, is 
the lender still required to refund any 
premiums for overlapping coverage to 
the borrower within 30 days?

208.25(g)(2)(ii) (Board); 12 CFR 339.7(b)(2) (FDIC);

760.7(b)(2) (NCUA).

32892 

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

Yes. The Regulation specifically 
requires the refund of force-placed 
insurance premiums and any related 
fees charged to the borrower for any 
overlap period within 30 days of receipt 
of a confirmation of a borrower’s 
existing flood insurance coverage 
without exception.160 

FORCE PLACEMENT 13. Is a lender 
permitted to increase, renew, or extend 
a designated loan that is currently 
insured by force-placed insurance? More 
specifically, if the borrower is 
undergoing a refinance or a loan 
modification, can the lender rely on the 
existing force-placed insurance to meet 
the mandatory purchase requirement? 
A lender can rely on existing force- 

placed insurance to satisfy the 
mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirement if the borrower does not 
purchase his or her own policy. The 
Regulation states that a lender ‘‘shall not 
make, increase, extend or renew any 
designated loan unless the building or 
mobile home and any personal property 
securing the loan is covered by flood 
insurance for the term of the loan.’’ 161 
Assuming the force-placed policy is in 
effect and otherwise satisfies the 
regulatory coverage standards, then that 
policy may satisfy the mandatory 
purchase requirement. 

A refinance is the ‘‘making’’ of a loan, 

and a loan modification that increases, 
renews, or extends a loan is a triggering 
event for the flood insurance 
requirements. See Applicability 6 and 
Applicability 13. Therefore, when a 
lender refinances, increases, renews, or 
extends an existing loan, the lender is 
required to provide the Notice of 
Special Flood Hazards, which details 
the borrower’s obligation to obtain a 
flood insurance policy for any building 
in an SFHA securing the loan.162 At that 
time, the lender, at its discretion, could 
encourage the borrower to purchase his 
or her own policy, which may be 
available for a lower premium amount. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 14. If a 

borrower’s force-placed flood insurance 
expires, is the lender required to send a 
force placement notification to the 
borrower prior to renewing the force- 
placed flood insurance coverage? 

No. The Regulation does not require 

the lender to send a notice to the 
borrower prior to renewing a force- 

160 12 CFR 22.7(b)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 

208.25(g)(2)(i) (Board); 12 CFR 339.7(b)(1) (FDIC); 
12 CFR 614.4945(b)(1) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.7(b)(1) (NCUA). 

placed policy. However, the lender or 
its servicer, at its discretion, may notify 
the borrower that the lender is planning 
to renew or has renewed the force- 
placed policy. Such a notification may 
encourage the borrower to purchase his 
or her own policy, which may be 
available for a lower premium amount. 
FORCE PLACEMENT 15. Are lenders 
required to have in place ‘‘Life-of-Loan’’ 
monitoring for continuous coverage of 
designated loans? 

Although there is no explicit duty to 
monitor flood insurance coverage over 
the life of the loan in the Act or 
Regulation, for purposes of safety and 
soundness, many lenders monitor the 
continuous coverage of flood insurance 
for the building or mobile home and any 
personal property securing the loan. 
Such a practice helps to ensure that 
lenders complete the force placement of 
flood insurance in a timely manner 
upon lapse of a policy, that there is 
continuous coverage to protect both the 
borrower and the lender, and that 
lenders are promptly made aware of 
flood map changes. 

FORCE PLACEMENT 16. If a lender or 

its servicer receives a notice of 
remapping that states that a property 
has been or will be remapped into an 
SFHA, what do the Act and Regulation 
require the lender or its servicer to do? 
The Act and Regulation provide that 
if a lender, or its servicer, determines at 
any time during the term of a designated 
loan, that a building or mobile home 
and any personal property securing a 
loan is uninsured or underinsured, the 
lender or its servicer must begin the 
notice and force placement process, as 
detailed in Q&A Force Placement 1.163 
A loan that is secured by property that 
was not located in an SFHA does not 
become a designated loan until the 
effective date of the map change that 
remaps the property into an SFHA. 
Therefore, when a lender or its servicer 
receives advance notice that a property 
will be remapped into an SFHA, the 
effective date of the remapping becomes 
the date on which the lender or its 
servicer must determine whether the 
property is covered by sufficient flood 
insurance. If the borrower does not 
purchase a flood insurance policy that 
begins on the effective date of the map 
change, the lender or its servicer must 
send the force placement notice to the 
borrower to purchase adequate flood 
insurance.164 Similar to the guidance set 
forth in Q&A Force Placement 4, a 

161 12 CFR 22.3(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(1) 

163 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(a) (NCUA). 

(Board); 12 CFR 339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) 
(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) (NCUA). 

lender also may send notice prior to the 
effective date of the map change as a 
courtesy. 

In addition, as of the effective date of 

the remapping, if the lender makes a 
determination that the property securing 
a designated loan is not covered by 
sufficient flood insurance, the lender or 
servicer must begin the force placement 
process and may charge the borrower for 
the force-placed insurance.165 However, 
if the borrower purchases an adequate 
flood insurance policy, the lender or 
servicer would need to reimburse the 
borrower for premiums and fees charged 
for the force-placed coverage during any 
period of overlapping coverage.166 

If the lender or its servicer receives 

notice after a property has been 
remapped into an SFHA, then the 
lender or its servicer must determine 
whether the property securing the loan 
is covered by sufficient flood insurance. 
The lender or its servicer must begin the 
notice and force placement process, as 
detailed in Q&A Force Placement 1, if 
the property is uninsured or 
underinsured.167 See also Q&A Force 
Placement 9. 

XVIII. Flood Insurance Requirements 
in the Event of the Sale or Transfer of 
a Designated Loan and/or Its Servicing 
Rights (Servicing) 

SERVICING 1. How do the flood 
insurance requirements under the 
Regulation apply to lenders under the 
following scenarios involving loan 
servicing? 

Scenario 1: A regulated lender 

originates a designated loan secured by 
a building or mobile home located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act. The regulated 
lender makes the initial flood 
determination, provides the borrower 
with appropriate notice, and flood 
insurance is obtained. The regulated 
lender initially services the loan; 
however, the regulated lender 
subsequently sells both the loan and the 
servicing rights to a nonregulated party. 
What are the regulated lender’s 
requirements under the Regulation? 
What are the regulated lender’s 
requirements under the Regulation if it 
only transfers or sells the servicing 
rights, but retains ownership of the 
loan?

32893 

The regulated lender must comply 
with all requirements of the Regulation, 
including making the initial flood 
determination, providing appropriate 
notice to the borrower, and ensuring 
that the proper amount of insurance is 
obtained. In the event the regulated 
lender sells or transfers the loan and 
servicing rights, the regulated lender 
must provide notice of the identity of 
the new servicer to the Administrator of 
FEMA or its designee if the policy is an 
NFIP policy.168 In the case of a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer, the lender should provide 
notice of the identity of the new servicer 
to the private insurer. Once the 
regulated lender has sold the loan and 
the servicing rights, the lender has no 
further obligation regarding flood 
insurance on the loan. 

If the regulated lender retains 

ownership of the loan and only transfers 
or sells the servicing rights to a 
nonregulated party, and the policy is an 
NFIP policy, the regulated lender must 
notify the Administrator of FEMA or its 
designee of the identity of the new 
servicer.169 In the case of a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer, the lender should provide 
notice of the identity of the new servicer 
to the private insurer. The servicing 
contract should require the servicer to 
comply with all the requirements that 
are imposed on the regulated lender as 
owner of the loan, including escrow of 
insurance premiums and force 
placement of insurance, if necessary. 
Generally, the Regulation does not 
impose obligations on a loan servicer 
independent from the obligations it 
imposes on the owner of a loan. Loan 
servicers are covered by the escrow, 
force placement, and flood hazard 
determination fee provisions of the Act 
and Regulation primarily so that they 
may perform the administrative tasks for 
the regulated lender, without fear of 
liability to the borrower for the 
imposition of unauthorized charges. It is 
the Agencies’ longstanding position that 
the obligation of a loan servicer to fulfill 
administrative duties with respect to the 
flood insurance requirements arises 
from the contractual relationship 
between the loan servicer and the 
regulated lender or from other 
commonly accepted standards for 
performance of servicing obligations. 
The regulated lender remains ultimately 
liable for fulfillment of those 
responsibilities and must take adequate

steps to ensure that the loan servicer 
maintains compliance with the flood 
insurance requirements. 

Scenario 2: A nonregulated lender 

originates a designated loan. The 
nonregulated lender does not make an 
initial flood determination or notify the 
borrower of the need to obtain 
insurance. The nonregulated lender 
sells the loan and servicing rights to a 
regulated lender. What are the regulated 
lender’s requirements under the 
Regulation? What are the regulated 
lender’s requirements if it only 
purchases the servicing rights? 

A regulated lender’s purchase of a 
loan and servicing rights, secured by a 
building or mobile home located in an 
SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act, is not an event 
that triggers certain requirements under 
the Regulation, such as making a new 
flood determination or requiring a 
borrower to purchase flood 
insurance.170 Those requirements only 
are triggered when a regulated lender 
makes, increases, extends, or renews a 
designated loan.171 A regulated lender’s 
purchase of a loan does not fall within 
any of those categories. However, if a 
regulated lender becomes aware at any 
point during the life of a designated 
loan that flood insurance is required,172 
then the regulated lender must comply 
with the Regulation, including force 
placing insurance, if necessary.173 
Depending upon the circumstances, as a 
matter of safety and soundness, the 
lender may undertake due diligence 
upon the purchase of a loan, which 
would make the lender aware of the lack 
of adequate flood insurance and trigger 
flood insurance compliance 
requirements. Further, if the purchasing 
lender subsequently extends, increases, 
or renews a designated loan, it must also 
comply with the Act and Regulation.174 
When a regulated lender purchases 

only the servicing rights to a loan 
originated by a nonregulated lender, the 
regulated lender is obligated to follow 
the terms of its servicing contract with 
the owner of the loan. In the event the 
regulated lender subsequently sells or 
transfers the servicing rights on that 
loan, the regulated lender must notify 
the Administrator of FEMA or its

servicer, if required to do so by the 
servicing contract with the owner of the 
loan.175 

SERVICING 2. When a lender makes 
a designated loan and will be servicing 
that loan, what are the requirements for 
notifying the Administrator of FEMA or 
the Administrator’s designee, i.e. the 
insurance provider? 

Under the Regulation, the 
Administrator’s designee is the 
insurance company issuing the flood 
insurance policy.176 The borrower’s 
purchase of an NFIP policy (or the 
lender’s force placement of an NFIP 
policy) will constitute notice to the 
Administrator of FEMA when the lender 
is servicing that loan. 

In the event the servicing is 
subsequently transferred to a new 
servicer, the lender must provide notice 
to the insurance company of the identity 
of the new servicer no later than 60 days 
after the effective date of such a 
change.177 

In the case of a flood insurance policy 

issued by a private insurer, the lender 
should provide notice to the flood 
insurance provider. If the lender does 
not provide this notice to the flood 
insurance provider, the provider will be 
unable to properly administer the 
policy, such as by providing notice to 
the servicer about the expiration of the 
flood insurance policy.

Federal  Register / Vol.  87,  No.  104 / Tuesday,  May  31,  2022 / Rules  and  Regulations 

SERVICING 4. Can delivery of the 
notice be made electronically, including 
batch transmission? 

Yes. The Regulation specifically 
permits transmission by electronic 
means.178 A timely batch transmission 
of the notice would also be permissible, 
if it is acceptable to the Administrator’s 
designee, i.e., the insurance provider. 
SERVICING 5. If the loan and its 
servicing rights are sold by the lender, 
is the lender required to provide notice 
to the Administrator or the 
Administrator’s designee (i.e., the 
insurance provider)? 

Yes, in the case of an NFIP policy.179 

Failure to provide such notice would 
defeat the purpose of the notice 
requirement because FEMA would have 
no record of the identity of either the 
owner or servicer of the loan. 

In the case of a flood insurance policy 

issued by a private insurer, the lender 
should provide notice to the flood 
insurance provider. If the lender does 
not provide this notice to the flood 
insurance provider, the provider will be 
unable to properly administer the 
policy, such as by providing notice to 
the servicer about the expiration of the 
flood insurance policy. 

SERVICING 6. Is a lender required to 
provide notice when the servicer, not the 
lender, sells or transfers the servicing 
rights to another servicer? 

No. After servicing rights are sold or 
transferred, the subsequent notification 
obligations applicable in connection 
with NFIP policies are the responsibility 
of the new servicer.180 The obligation of 
the lender to notify the Administrator or 
the Administrator’s designee (i.e., the 
insurance provider) of the identity of 
the servicer transfers to the new 
servicer. The duty to notify the 
insurance provider of any subsequent 
sale or transfer of the servicing rights 
and responsibilities belongs to that 
servicer.181 For example, if a lender 
makes and services a loan and then sells 
the loan in the secondary market and 
also sells the servicing rights to a 
mortgage company, then the lender 
must notify the insurance provider of 
the identity of the new servicer and the 
other information requested by FEMA 
so that flood insurance transactions can 
be properly administered by the 
insurance provider. If the mortgage

(Board); 12 CFR 339.10(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 
614.4960(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.10(a) (NCUA). 

179 12 CFR 22.10 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(j) (Board); 
12 CFR 339.10 (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4960 (FCA); and 
12 CFR 760.10 (NCUA).

company later sells the servicing rights 
to another firm, the mortgage company, 
not the lender, is responsible for 
notifying the insurance provider of the 
identity of the new servicer. 

Similarly, for a flood insurance policy 

issued by a private insurer, if a lender 
sells or transfers the servicing rights, the 
Agencies do not expect the lender to 
provide notice to the insurance provider 
of any subsequent sale or transfer of the 
servicing rights. 

SERVICING 7. In the event of a merger 

or acquisition of one lender with 
another, what are the responsibilities of 
the parties for notifying the 
Administrator’s designee (i.e., the 
insurance provider)? 

If a lender is acquired by or merges 

with another lender, the duty in 
connection with NFIP policies to 
provide notice for the loans being 
serviced by the acquired lender will fall 
to the successor lender in the event that 
notification is not provided by the 
acquired lender prior to the effective 
date of the acquisition or merger. 

Similarly, for a flood insurance policy 

issued by a private insurer, the 
successor lender should provide notice 
to the flood insurance provider in the 
event that notification is not provided 
by the acquired lender prior to the 
effective date of the acquisition or 
merger. 

XIX. Mandatory Civil Money Penalties 
(Penalty) 

PENALTY 1. Which violations of the 

Act can result in a mandatory civil 
money penalty? 

A pattern or practice of violations of 
any of the following requirements of the 
Act and its implementing Regulation 
triggers a mandatory civil money 
penalty: 

• Purchase of flood insurance where 

available (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)); 
• Escrow of flood insurance 
premiums (42 U.S.C. 4012a(d)); 

• Failure to provide force placement 

notice or purchase force-placed flood 
insurance coverage, as appropriate (42 
U.S.C. 4012a(e)); 

• Notice of special flood hazards and 
the availability of Federal disaster relief 
assistance (42 U.S.C. 4104a(a)); and 

• Notice of servicer and any change of 

servicer (42 U.S.C. 4104a(b)). 

The Act provides that any regulated 

lending institution found to have a 
pattern or practice of the violations 
‘‘shall be assessed a civil penalty’’ by its 
Federal supervisory agency in an 
amount not to exceed $2,000 per 
violation (42 U.S.C. 4012a(f)(5)). There 
is no ceiling on the total penalty amount 
that a Federal supervisory agency can 
assess for a pattern or practice of 

violations. Each Agency adjusts the 
limit pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 
1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note).182 As 
required by the Act, the penalties must 
be paid into the National Flood 
Mitigation Fund.183 

PENALTY 2. What constitutes a 
‘‘pattern or practice’’ of violations for 
which civil money penalties must be 
imposed under the Act? 

The Act does not define ‘‘pattern or 

practice.’’ The Agencies make a 
determination of whether a pattern or 
practice exists by weighing the 
individual facts and circumstances of 
each case. In making the determination, 
the Agencies look both to guidance and 
experience with determinations of 
pattern or practice under other 
regulations (such as Regulation B (Equal 
Credit Opportunity) and Regulation Z 
(Truth in Lending)), as well as Agencies’ 
precedents in considering the 
assessment of civil money penalties for 
flood insurance violations. The Policy 
Statement on Discrimination in Lending 
(Policy Statement) provided the 
following guidance on what constitutes 
a pattern or practice: Isolated, unrelated, 
or accidental occurrences will not 
constitute a pattern or practice. 
However, repeated, intentional, regular, 
usual, deliberate, or institutionalized 
practices will almost always constitute 
a pattern or practice. The totality of the 
circumstances must be considered when 
assessing whether a pattern or practice 
is present. 

In determining whether a lender has 
engaged in a pattern or practice of flood 
insurance violations, the Agencies’ 
considerations may include, but are not 
limited to, the presence of one or more 
of the following factors: 

• Whether the conduct resulted from 

a common cause or source within the 
lender’s control; 

• Whether the conduct appears to be 

grounded in a written or unwritten 
policy or established process; 

• Whether the noncompliance 
occurred over an extended period of 
time; 

• The relationship of the instances of 

noncompliance to one another (for 
example, whether the instances of 
noncompliance occurred in the same 
area of a lender’s operations); 

182 Public Law 101–410, Oct. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 

890. This act was amended by the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements 
Act of 2015, Public Law 114–74, Title VII, section 
701(b), Nov. 2, 2015, 129 Stat. 599. Please refer to 
12 CFR 19.240(b) & 12 CFR 109.103(c)(2) (OCC); 12 
CFR 263.65(b) (Board); 12 CFR 308.132(d)(18) 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 622.61(b) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
747.1001 (NCUA) for the Agencies’ current civil 
penalty limits.

• Whether the number of instances of 
noncompliance is significant relative to 
the total number of applicable 
transactions. (Depending on the 
circumstances, however, violations that 
involve only a small percentage of a 
lender’s total activity could constitute a 
pattern or practice); 

• Whether a lender was cited for 
violations of the Act and Regulation at 
prior examinations and the steps taken 
by the lender to correct the identified 
deficiencies; 

• Whether a lender’s internal and/or 
external audit process had not identified 
and addressed deficiencies in its flood 
insurance compliance; and 

• Whether the lender lacks generally 

effective flood insurance compliance 
policies and procedures and/or a 
training program for its employees. 

Although these considerations are not 
dispositive of a final resolution, they do 
serve as a reference point in assessing 
whether there may be a pattern or 
practice of violations of the Act and 
Regulation in a particular case. As 
previously stated, the presence or 
absence of one or more of these 

considerations may not eliminate a 
finding that a pattern or practice exists.

October 16, 2025

The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced the withdrawal of interagency Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.

The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities. In addition, all supervised institutions are expected to consider and appropriately address all material financial risks and should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.

The interagency principles were previously issued jointly by the agencies in October 2023. The notice, which will be issued in the Federal Register , rescinds these principles effective immediately. The OCC withdrew its participation in the principles earlier this year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  

I. Background 

On October 30, 2023, after issuing separate requests for comment,1 the agencies jointly 

issued Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management (principles).2  These

principles were intended for financial institutions3 with over $100 billion in total consolidated 

assets.  On March 31, 2025, the OCC withdrew its participation in the principles.4  

II. Rescission of Guidance  

The agencies’ existing safety and soundness standards require all insured depository 

institutions to have effective risk management processes commensurate with the size, complexity 

and risk of their activities.5  In addition, financial institutions of all sizes are expected to consider 

and appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment and should be resilient 

to a range of risks, including emerging risks.6  The agencies do not believe principles for the 

management of climate-related financial risk are necessary and are concerned that such 

principles could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed 

by financial institutions’ existing risk management processes and the agencies’ other risk 

management rules and guidance. 7  Therefore, the principles are rescinded. 

III. Administrative Law Matters 

3 In this issuance, the term “financial institution” or “institution” includes national banks, Federal savings 
associations, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, state nonmember banks, state savings associations, state 
member banks, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, intermediate holding companies, 
foreign banking organizations with respect to their U.S. operations, and non-bank systemically important financial 
institutions (SIFIs) supervised by the Board. 

4 OCC Withdraws Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, News 
Release 2025-27 (March 31, 2025). 

5 Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, requires the FDIC, Board, and OCC to 
prescribe safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions.  Such standards were implemented by 
rule in 12 CFR part 364, appendix A (FDIC), 12 CFR part 208, appendix D-1 (Board), and 12 CFR part 30, 
appendix A (OCC).  These guidelines address, among other things, operational and managerial standards relating to 
(1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit 
underwriting; and (4) interest rate risk exposure.  

6 See, e.g., SR Letter 95-51 (as revised June 23, 2025); SR Letter 21-3 (February 26, 2021); OCC Comptroller’s 
Handbook, Bank Supervision Process; FDIC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies, Section 4.1 
Management. 

7 Neither the principles nor this rescission requires or prohibits financial institutions’ consideration of any particular 
risk or set of risks, nor do they create any rights or obligations for financial institutions.

A. Executive Order 12866 

Pursuant to section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, the Office of Information and 

Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that the 

rescission is a “significant regulatory action.” 

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) (PRA) states that no 

agency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information 

collection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. 

The rescission does not create any new, or revise any existing, collections of information 

under the PRA. Therefore, no information collection request will be submitted to the OMB for 

review.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

     Date:  October 2, 2025 

        To:  Board of Governors 

   From: 

Staff1 

Subject:  Rescission of the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for 

Large Financial Institutions 

ACTIONS REQUESTED:  Approval to publish in the Federal Register the attached draft 

notice that would rescind the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for 

Large Financial Institutions (the “Climate Principles”).  The notice rescinding the Climate 

Principles would be published jointly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) 

and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  Staff also requests authority to take 

such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the Board’s prompt rescission of the Climate 

Principles, including to make technical, non-substantive changes to the attached materials prior 

to publication in the Federal Register.   

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 

• 

In 2023, the Board jointly issued the Climate Principles with the FDIC and the OCC.  
The Climate Principles were intended for financial institutions with over $100 billion in 
total consolidated assets.  

•  Financial institutions are expected to consider and appropriately address all material risks 
in their operating environment, and should be resilient to a range of risks, including 
emerging risks.  Staff believes that the Climate Principles may be distracting large 
financial institutions from the management of material financial risks and believes the 
Climate Principles are not necessary.    

•  Accordingly, staff recommends that the Board approve the rescission of the Climate 

Principles, as well as authorize staff to take such actions as are necessary to effectuate the 
rescission.   

1  Legal Division (Mark Van Der Weide, Reena Sahni, and Asad Kudiya); Division of 
Supervision and Regulation (Mary Aiken and Anna Lee Hewko). 

     
 
DISCUSSION: 

In October 2023, the Board, FDIC, and OCC (collectively, the “Agencies”) jointly 

issued the Climate Principles.2  The Climate Principles were intended for financial 

institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.   

The Climate Principles outlined a set of general principles for climate-related 

financial risk management that cover six areas:  governance; policies, procedures, and limits; 

strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement, and reporting; and scenario 

analysis.  In addition, the Climate Principles included a section on “management of risk 

areas,” which describes how climate-related financial risks can be addressed in certain 

traditional risk categories, such as credit, liquidity, other financial risks, operational, legal 

and compliance, and other non-financial risks. 

Staff believes that the Climate Principles are not necessary and may be distracting large 

financial institutions from the management of material financial risks.  Financial institutions of 

all sizes are expected to consider and appropriately address all material risks in their operating 

environment and should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.3  Further, 

existing safety and soundness standards require large financial institutions to have effective risk 

management processes commensurate with the size, complexity and risk of their activities.  As a 

result, staff believes the Climate Principles are not necessary and that existing risk 

management frameworks described in the Agencies’ other rules and guidance are sufficient 

to help ensure financial institutions are managing all material risks.  In light of similar 

considerations, the OCC announced that it was withdrawing from participation in the Climate 

Principles in March 2025.4      

2  88 Fed. Reg. 74183 (October 30, 2023).  The Board, OCC, and FDIC had previously proposed 
draft principles and requested public comment.  See OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021) 
(OCC); 87 Fed. Reg. 19507 (April 4, 2022) (FDIC); 87 Fed. Reg. 75267 (December 8, 2022) 
(Board).   
3  See, e.g., SR Letter 95-51 (as revised June 23, 2025); SR Letter 21-3 (February 26, 2021); 
OCC Comptroller’s Handbook, Bank Supervision Process; FDIC Risk Management Manual of 
Examination Policies, Section 4.1 Management. 
4  OCC, News Release 2025-27 (March 31, 2025).  

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

For the reasons discussed above, staff recommends (i) that the Board approve the 

attached draft Federal Register notice that would rescind the Climate Principles; and 

(ii) authorization for staff to take such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the Board’s 

prompt rescission of the Climate Principles, including any necessary technical, non-substantive 

changes to the notice before publication in the Federal Register.

Title: Federal Reserve and FDIC release public sections of resolution plans for several large banking organizations
Date: 2025-10-23

October 23, 2025

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today released the public sections of resolution plans for fifteen large banking organizations, including five domestic and 10 foreign banking organizations. These firms were required to submit resolution plans by October 1, 2025.

Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, are required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These plans describe a firm's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. The firms' confidential plans include a public section that provides a summary of elements of the resolution plan.

The agencies also released a public summary of Capital One Financial Corporation's interim update to its resolution plan, which was filed following Capital One's recent acquisition of Discover. Capital One will file a full resolution plan with a public section by July 1, 2026.

The public sections of the resolution plans and update are available on the FDIC's and the Board's websites.

Consistent with its prior statement, the Federal Reserve Board on Friday requested comment on proposals to enhance the transparency and public accountability of its annual stress test. The proposals seek comment on: the stress test models; changes to the framework that guides the design of the hypothetical scenarios; and the hypothetical scenarios for the upcoming 2026 stress test.

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to ensure that large banks are sufficiently capitalized and able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. In December 2024, the Board announced it would modify the test in important respects to improve its resilience.

"In an effort to avoid litigation, the Board committed to make significant improvements in the transparency of the stress tests. These proposals take a necessary step toward fulfilling that commitment, and would promote due process," said Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman. "Regulated firms should be subject to clearly articulated and transparent rules. Capital requirements should not be set in a way that is shielded from meaningful public scrutiny. As vice chair for supervision, I am committed to providing transparency and accountability for both the Board and our supervised firms. This is essential for maintaining the value of our stress testing program, and for supervision and regulation more broadly."

The proposals request comment on several other elements, including an enhanced disclosure process for future stress test cycles, adjustments to the annual timeline to accommodate a comment period for scenarios, and enhancements to reporting forms to reduce burden and improve risk capture.

Annual stress test outcomes vary from year to year based on a number of factors including scenario design. Although historically, outcomes have varied significantly, resulting in volatility in capital requirements from year to year based on that design, in aggregate, the Board estimates that the proposed stress test model and scenario changes would not materially change capital requirements for firms subject to the supervisory stress test, across various stress scenarios and starting test conditions.

Comments on the 2026 scenarios are due by December 1, 2025. Comments on the proposal enhancing model and scenario transparency are due by January 22, 2026.

   From: 

Subject: 

Proposals to enhance the transparency and public accountability of the Board’s stress 
testing framework 

ACTIONS REQUESTED:  Approval of (1) a notice of proposed rulemaking to (i) publish the 

supervisory stress test models for public comment; (ii) publish amendments to the Policy 

Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing, including the implementation 

of guides for additional scenario variables, for public comment; and (iii) publish amendments to 

the Stress Testing Policy Statement for public comment ((i)-(iii), the “transparency and public 

accountability notice”); and (2) a notice to publish the 2026 supervisory stress test scenarios, and 

models used for supervisory stress test scenario generation, for public comment (the “2026 

scenarios notice”) (collectively, the “proposal”).  The transparency and public accountability 

notice would also codify an enhanced process for publishing the stress test models, for seeking 

public comment on material changes to the stress test models, and for publishing and seeking 

public comment on the annual stress test scenarios.  Additionally, the transparency and public 

accountability notice would propose targeted changes to the FR Y-14A/M/Q reports to remove 

data items no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test, as well as to collect additional 

data that would support the stress test models and improve risk capture.  Staff also request 

authority to make technical, non-substantive changes to the attached materials prior to 

publication.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 

•  The proposal is intended to enhance the transparency and public accountability of the 

Board’s stress test framework, consistent with the December 2024 Board press release.2   

•  The transparency and public accountability notice would disclose and seek public comment 
on the models the Board plans to use to conduct the 2026 supervisory stress test.  It would 
also disclose and seek public comment on proposed changes to these models relative to the 
2025 supervisory stress test, including proposed changes to address the sensitivity of pre-
provision net revenue projections to recent firm performance.  See Appendix A for a 
summary of the proposed model changes and their estimated capital impact.   

o  The model documentation would generally include the equations, variables, and 

coefficients for each model; assumptions and limitations of each model; rationale for 
modeling decisions; and discussions of alternative models or modeling choices.   

•  The transparency and public accountability notice would propose to codify an enhanced 
disclosure process in the Board’s regulations under which the Board would commit to 
maintaining transparency and facilitating public participation with respect to the stress test 
models and scenarios.   

o  The proposed enhanced disclosure process would require the Board to annually 

disclose the model documentation and scenarios and invite public comment on the 
scenarios and any material changes to the models before such changes are 
implemented in the supervisory stress test. 

o  To accommodate the proposed public comment process on the stress test scenarios, 
the proposal would shift the jump-off date of the stress test from December 31 to 
September 30. 

o  The transparency and public accountability notice would invite public comment on 
proposed amendments to the Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement in accordance 
with the proposed enhanced disclosure process. 

•  The transparency and public accountability notice would invite public comment on proposed 
amendments to the Board’s Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress 
Testing (Scenario Design Policy Statement) that include (1) proposed guides for seven 
additional domestic scenario variables (see Appendix C for a summary of the proposed 

2  See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241223a.htm.  See also

guides),3 and (2) a detailed description of the approaches for producing the scenario variable 
paths.  These amendments aim to balance the transparency and predictability of the annual 
stress test scenario design process by having a consistent process for all scenario variables. 

•  The transparency and public accountability notice would describe changes to simplify the 

global market shock scenario and implement shorter liquidity horizons that better align with 
the nature of an instantaneous shock in the proposed amendments to the Scenario Design 
Policy Statement.  The transparency and public accountability notice would also propose to 
revise the Board’s regulations to expand the as-of date range of the global market shock.  
This expansion aims to increase the global market shock’s ability to capture a spectrum of 
market risks across different time periods, thereby enhancing the overall risk assessment 
capabilities of the stress test.  

•  The transparency and public accountability notice would modify certain elements of the FR 
Y-14A/Q/M reporting forms to remove several data items and supporting documentation 
requirements that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test and to collect 
additional data to improve risk capture. The removal of the supporting documentation 
requirement is expected to reduce submitted documentation by over 10,000 pages, on 
average, for each firm subject to the requirement.   

•  The 2026 scenarios notice would invite public comment on descriptions of the proposed 
2026 stress test scenarios.  It would also disclose and seek public comment on the 
macroeconomic model used to provide the paths of variables not specified with guides, as 
well as the modeling approaches used to derive shock values in the global market shock.  
This notice would specify the paths of the scenario variables, including the values for the 
global market shock variables, consistent with the Board’s disclosures of the stress test 
scenarios from previous stress test cycles.  

• 

In aggregate, the stress test model and scenario changes are not expected to materially 
change capital requirements for firms subject to the supervisory stress test. 

BACKGROUND:  

Stress testing is a core element of the Board’s regulatory framework and supervisory 

program for large firms.  The stress test enables the Board to assess whether large bank holding 

3  The Board currently provides guides for the paths of the unemployment rate and for the ratio 
of housing prices to disposable income.  The proposal would include guides for seven additional 
domestic scenario variables: BBB spread, equity prices, commercial real estate prices, mortgage 
spreads, 5-year Treasury yield, 10-year Treasury yield, and the Chicago Board Options 
Exchange’s Volatility Index (VIX).  The Board is proposing to use guides or use a model in the 
process for setting all scenario variables, including international variables, for completeness and 
consistency.

companies, savings and loan holding companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign 

banking organizations, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board (collectively, 

firms) have sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue lending under a set of 

hypothetical severely adverse conditions.4  Since 2009, the common equity capital ratios of firms 

subject to the test have more than doubled, with common equity capital of such firms increasing 

by over $1 trillion.5   

Since 2020, the supervisory stress test results have also informed a firm’s stress capital 

buffer requirement.6  Greater transparency would allow firms to better understand the capital 

requirements associated with investment and expansion of different business lines and would 

facilitate more effective long-term capital planning.  This, in turn, could enhance firms’ ability to 

supply credit to households and businesses, ultimately supporting economic growth and financial 

stability. 

4  See 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i)(1).  Section 401(e) of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and 
Consumer Protection Act requires the Board to conduct periodic stress tests for bank holding 
companies with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.  12 U.S.C. 
§ 5365 note (Supervisory Stress Test).   
5  Based on FR Y-9C (Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies) filings. 
6  In 2020, the Board finalized a rule to integrate supervisory stress test results into the capital 
framework, through the stress capital buffer requirement.  See 85 FR 15576 (March 18, 2020).  
The stress capital buffer requirement is calculated as the difference between a firm’s starting and 
lowest projected common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario in the 
supervisory stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, expressed as a 
percentage of risk-weighted assets.  See 12 CFR 225.8(f); 12 CFR 238.170(f).  The stress capital 
buffer requirement framework generally applies to firms with $100 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets. 

4 

 
 
 
Stress Test Models 

The Board uses models to generate the results of the supervisory stress test.  The Board 

has previously disclosed certain information regarding these models and its model development 

process, most notably in the Stress Testing Policy Statement,7 the Enhanced Disclosure of the 

Models Used in the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Stress Test (Enhanced Model Disclosure),8 

and the related annual model methodology document.  The Stress Testing Policy Statement 

describes the Board’s policies and procedures that guide the development, implementation, and 

validation of the models.  The Enhanced Model Disclosure supplemented prior public 

descriptions of the models by providing some information about their structure and by including 

a list of key variables that influence the results of each model.9  However, more detailed  

information would improve the ability of firms to accurately assess how changes in their 

business activities might impact their supervisory stress test results and, relatedly, their stress 

capital buffer requirements and overall capital requirements.       

Stress Test Scenarios 

The Board conducts the supervisory stress test using the severely adverse scenario.  The 

severely adverse scenario describes a hypothetical set of conditions designed to assess the 

strength and resilience of firms in a severely adverse economic environment and includes 28 

7  12 CFR Part 252, Appendix B. 
8  See 84 FR 6784 (February 28, 2019).

https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2025-june-supervisory-stress-test-methodology-
introduction.htm.  

5 

 
 
 
variables that are disclosed by the Board each year prior to the supervisory stress test.  These 

variables serve as an input to the calculation of supervisory stress test results for all firms.   

For a subset of firms, the severely adverse scenario also includes two additional 

components: the global market shock component and the largest counterparty default 

component.10  The global market shock component applies to firms with a significant amount of 

trading activity.  The global market shock is a set of hypothetical shocks to a large set of risk 

factors reflecting general market distress and heightened uncertainty and is used to project mark-

to-market losses on market risk exposures, which feed into a covered firm’s stress test results.  

The global market shock component is applied to asset positions held by the firms on a given as-

of date.  Under the Board’s current regulations, the as-of date of the global market shock 

component must occur between October 1 of the previous calendar year and March 1 of the 

calendar year in which the stress test is performed.11  In addition, for certain large and highly 

interconnected firms, the same global market shock component is applied to counterparty 

exposures under the largest counterparty default component.12  The largest counterparty default 

component is intended to assess the potential losses and capital impact associated with the 

default of each covered firm’s largest counterparty, and the as-of date aligns with that of the 

global market shock component.  

The Board has enhanced the transparency of its scenario design process over time.  The 

Board issued the Scenario Design Policy Statement in 2013 and finalized the current version in 

10  See 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i) and 252.54(b)(2)(i).   
11  12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 252.14(b)(2)(i); 252.54(b)(2)(i). 
12  The largest counterparty default component generally applies to all firms subject to the global 
market shock component, as well as firms with substantial processing and custodial operations. 

6 

 
 
 
2019.13  The Scenario Design Policy Statement sets guides for the paths of the unemployment 

rate and for the ratio of housing prices to disposable income.  However, the description of the 

process for determining the paths of the other variables is currently limited.  The Board could 

make the design of scenarios more transparent and predictable by providing additional guides for 

certain macroeconomic variables, posting comprehensive descriptions of models used in the 

design of the macroeconomic scenario and global market shock component, and disclosing 

additional detailed information on the methodology used to create the global market shock 

component of the severely adverse scenario.   

DISCUSSION: 

A.  Enhanced Transparency of the Supervisory Stress Test 

Consistent with the Board’s December 2024 press release, the transparency and public 

accountability notice would publish for public comment comprehensive documentation on the 

Board’s stress test models.14  This comprehensive documentation would include the equations, 

variables, and coefficients used in each model; assumptions and limitations of each model; 

rationale for modeling decisions; and discussions of alternative models.  The transparency and 

public accountability notice would also codify an enhanced disclosure process under which the 

Board would annually publish updated comprehensive documentation on the stress test models, 

13  See 78 FR 71435 (2013 version); 84 FR 6651 (2019 amendments); 12 CFR Part 252, 
Appendix A. 
14  The comprehensive model documentation would be published on the Board’s website; the 
transparency and public accountability notice would provide a link and request public comment 
on the documentation.   

7 

 
 
 
invite public comment on any material changes that the Board seeks to make to those models, 

and annually publish the stress test scenarios for public comment.   

Stress Test Model Changes 

Each year, the Board refines and enhances its stress test models to reflect advances in 

modeling techniques, respond to model validation findings, incorporate richer and more detailed 

data, or identify models with improved performance.  These changes ensure that the models are 

able to remain dynamic (i.e., can be enhanced to capture emerging risks), produce reasonable 

results, and can identify salient risks at firms.  The Board currently maintains a robust internal 

process for assessing, validating, and implementing model changes.  For additional transparency 

and public accountability, the proposal would publish descriptions of, and invite public comment 

on, several proposed changes to the models (relative to the models used in the 2025 cycle) for 

implementation in future stress tests.15  These proposed changes are intended to simplify and 

improve the models.  A summary of these proposed changes is included in Appendix A. 

Process for Future Model Updates and Stress Test Results 

As part of the transparency and public accountability notice, the Board would commit to 

publish for public comment any material model changes before implementing them in a 

supervisory stress test.16  Seeking public comment before implementing material model changes 

15  These proposed changes would be summarized in the transparency and public accountability 
notice; detailed discussions of these proposed changes would be published on the Board’s 
website along with the comprehensive model documentation.  
16  The proposal would request public comment on the following definition of materiality:  a 
“material model change” means a model change that could have, in the Board’s estimation, an 
impact on the post-stress CET1 regulatory capital ratio of any firm, or on the average post-stress 
CET1 capital ratios of all firms required to participate in the upcoming stress test cycle, based on 

8 

 
 
 
 
would facilitate public participation with respect to the models and help to ensure that any 

material model changes are sound and effective for use in the supervisory stress test.  In addition, 

as part of the annual publication of the comprehensive stress test model documentation, the 

Board would identify any non-material changes made to the models.  Taken together, the policies 

for model changes would help to ensure that the models maintain an optimal level of robustness 

and stability, while ensuring material changes are transparent and benefit from public feedback 

before they are implemented.   

The transparency and public accountability notice would also seek public comment on 

revisions to the Stress Testing Policy Statement in accordance with the proposed enhanced 

disclosure process.  For example, it would propose to revise the Stress Testing Policy Statement 

to facilitate disclosing additional information directly to a firm about that firm’s own stress test 

results.   

Publishing comprehensive documentation on the stress test models for public comment, as 

well as committing to future enhanced disclosures, has costs and benefits.  For example, it could 

contribute to a model monoculture or delay material model changes while risks build up in areas 

that are treated relatively benignly in the stress test.  Yet, disclosure under the proposal would 

also have meaningful benefits.  First, the increase in transparency would increase public 

accountability and instill confidence in the fairness of the supervisory stress tests.  Second, the 

the prior year’s severely adverse scenario and prior year’s input data, equal to (i) a change of 20 
basis points or more in the projected CET1 ratio of any such firm; or (ii) a change of 10 basis 
points or more in the average of the absolute change to the values of the projected CET1 ratios of 
such firms.  The proposal would also solicit public comment on alternative thresholds for, and 
definitions of, materiality. The proposal would also define a model change to mean “the 
introduction of a new model or a conceptual change to an existing model.” 

9 

 
 
 
disclosure process would create a new mechanism for obtaining feedback from the public, 

including academics, financial analysts, and firms, on the design and specifications of the 

models, which should lead to model improvements.  Third, a firm would have a better sense of 

how its risk profile would factor into its stress capital buffer requirement, which would reduce 

the likelihood of unanticipated stress test results and allow for better capital and business 

planning by firms.  Finally, the public disclosure of additional information about supervisory 

stress tests should strengthen market discipline, because investors, counterparties, and rating 

agencies would be able to better assess a firm’s risk profile.17   

B.  Revisions to Scenario Design Policy Statement 

Under the transparency and public accountability notice, the Board would also seek 

public comment on revisions to the Scenario Design Policy Statement that are intended to 

increase the predictability and transparency of the supervisory stress test.   

Future Scenarios Disclosures 

The revised Scenario Design Policy Statement would include a description of an annual 

process that the Board would undertake to seek feedback on the supervisory stress test scenarios 

prior to their finalization.  This process would look similar to the process the Board would use to 

solicit public comment on the 2026 scenarios.  Under the revised process, the Board expects to 

release scenarios for public comment on or around October 15 each year for at least a 30-day 

period.  The timing of the release and duration of the public comment period will allow the 

17  See, e.g., Gambetta, N., García-Benau, M.A. and Zorio-Grima, A., 2019. Stress test impact 
and bank risk profile: Evidence from macro stress testing in Europe. International Review of 
Economics & Finance, 61, pp. 347–354; and Goldstein, I. and Leitner, Y., 2022. Stress test 
disclosure: theory, practice, and new perspectives. Chapter 11 of Handbook of Financial Stress 
Testing. 

10 

 
 
 
Board sufficient time to receive and respond to public comments and then finalize each year’s 

scenarios by February 15 in each annual stress test cycle (consistent with current practice).  The 

transparency and public accountability notice would also propose to codify this annual process in 

the Board’s regulations.  To accommodate the public comment process, the proposal would also 

shift the jump-off date of the stress test from December 31 to September 30.18 

Variable Guides and Model Disclosures 

The revised Scenario Design Policy Statement would include scenario guides for an 

expanded set of financial market variables in the macroeconomic scenario, and enhancements to 

the existing unemployment rate and housing price guides.  The new enhanced set of guides 

would describe the process used to set the paths of the variables throughout the duration of the 

stress test, including the peak or trough values, the timing of these values, and the trajectory 

between the starting values and those points.  The revised Scenario Design Policy Statement 

would also contain additional information about the framework and model components used to 

create the global market shock, including a description of the logic underlying the severity of the 

shock, as well as a description of the models and processes used to generate the shock. 

The transparency and public accountability notice would include details on a 

macroeconomic model used to formulate the paths of the variables that are not determined by a 

guide for a given annual scenario, including GDP, inflation, and the 3-month Treasury bill rate.  

This model was developed to meet the needs of the stress testing program for the paths of 

18  The change to the jump-off date would also help to ensure that economic data and firm’s 
balance sheets would be set prior to the release of the proposed scenarios. The proposal would 
also implement technical changes to align the dividend add-on component of the stress capital 
buffer requirement with the proposed jump-off date. 

11 

 
 
 
 
scenario variables to be internally consistent and to be suitable for public release and comment.  

The transparency and public accountability notice would specify that the macroeconomic model 

is used solely for supervisory stress testing purposes and that the output is not a forecast of the 

Board.  As a result of these revisions, the severely adverse scenario would be more transparent 

and predictable across supervisory stress tests.   

Additional Global Market Shock Revisions 

Under the proposal, the as-of date window for the global market shock would widen.  

Currently, the as-of date window runs from October 1 of the year preceding the stress test to 

March 1 of the year of the stress test.  Under the proposal, the as-of date window would run from 

the October 1 that occurs two years preceding the stress test to the October 1 the occurs in the  

year preceding the stress test.19  This new range would allow the global market shock to capture 

a range of market risks across different time periods, thereby improving the risk capture of the 

global market shock.   

The transparency and public accountability notice would seek feedback on the Board’s 

intention to streamline the global market shock methodology by reducing the number of modeled 

risk factors.  Currently, the global market shock includes more than 20,000 risk factors that 

reflect sudden market distress and heightened uncertainty.  This approach would reduce the 

disclosed number of modeled risk factors to approximately 2,300 based on their relevance for 

19  For example, under the proposal, the global market shock as-of date could fall on any date 
between October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025, for the 2026 stress test.   

12 

 
 
 
developing a global market shock scenario narrative, the materiality of the risk factors, data 

quality, and consistency across asset classes.20   

Additionally, the transparency and public accountability notice would seek feedback on a 

proposal to reduce the length of liquidity horizons in the global market shock.  A liquidity 

horizon is the time assumed to be required to exit or hedge a risk position without materially 

affecting market prices in stressed market conditions.  Global market shock losses are recognized 

in the first quarter of the stress test projection horizon, which reflects the fact that market 

dislocations that would affect mark-to-market positions can happen rapidly and unpredictably, at 

any time, under stressed conditions.  However, the current length of liquidity horizons ranges 

from 3 months to 12 months, which may not conceptually align with an “instantaneous” shock 

and can lead to potential incoherence between the macroeconomic scenario, which is recognized 

over a nine-quarter projection horizon, and the global market shock, which is recognized in the 

first quarter of the projection horizon.  The proposal would seek comment on a proposal to 

reduce the liquidity horizons in the global market shock to 1 month for liquid asset classes and to 

3 months for illiquid asset classes.   

C.  2026 Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios 

Under the 2026 scenarios notice, the Board would seek public comment on the scenarios 

used for the 2026 supervisory stress test.   

20  To facilitate this transition, the values for the remaining shocks would still be provided as part 
of the 2026 supervisory stress test scenarios notice.  Providing the values for all the shocks for at 
least the 2026 scenarios may mitigate the impact of firms having to change their operational 
systems to process the global market shock values. 

13 

 
 
 
The 2026 proposed severely adverse macroeconomic scenario is characterized by a 

hypothetical global recession triggered by an abrupt decline in risk appetite that causes 

substantial declines in the prices of risky assets, declines in risk-free interest rates, and high 

levels of volatility.  Equity prices fall more than 50 percent in the first three quarters of the 

scenario, while the VIX spikes and reaches a peak of above 70 percent in the second quarter of 

the scenario.21  The increase in market volatility also leads to a widening in BBB corporate bond 

spreads to a level of 5.7 percentage points.  Those disruptions depress demand for goods and 

services from households and prompt businesses to dramatically reduce employment and 

investment, conditions from which the economy and asset prices are slow to recover.  The U.S. 

unemployment rate rises 5.5 percentage points from the scenario’s currently projected starting 

point of 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to its peak of 10 percent in the third quarter of 

2027.  The sharp decline in economic activity leads to a collapse in real estate prices, including a 

40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices and a 29 percent decline in house prices.22   

The international portion of the scenario features recessions in three countries or country 

blocs and a sharp slowdown in developing Asia, followed by declines in inflation, with all 

countries or country blocs experiencing deflation.  The value of the U.S. dollar appreciates 

against all countries and country blocs’ currencies, except for the Japanese yen.  The 2026 

21  Equity prices are determined by a formula that adjusts to the change in equity prices over the 
past 12 months. The actual change in equity prices in the scenario will be determined by the level 
of the market on the data jump-off date for the scenario. 
22  As with equity prices, the final change in house prices in the scenario is determined by a 
formula that uses the most up-to-date information at scenario publication. Therefore, this aspect 
of the scenario could change based on published data for house prices and disposable personal 
income in coming months.

in the revised Scenario Design Policy Statement, including those for U.S. unemployment, real 

estate prices, and core financial market variables, as well as the new model for the other 

variables.  The proposed 2026 scenario is also consistent with the current Scenario Design Policy 

Statement. The 2026 global market shock is characterized by heightened market expectations of 

persistently high inflation and higher commodity prices, which could lead to a global recession 

The scenario has certain elements in common with prior episodes of market reactions to 

periods of expected high inflation combined with low growth, such as the oil crisis of the 1970s.  

That period was also characterized by commodity price increases.   

In the scenario, both short-term and long-term Treasury rates rise sharply, driven by 

higher inflation expectations.  Heightened inflation expectations drive commodity 

prices upward. The expected fall in economic activity leads to notable equity price declines 

across global markets.  Concerns about corporate credit defaults in light of the economic 

slowdown leads to wider credit spreads.  The U.S. dollar strengthens, exhibiting large gains 

against the Euro and moderate gains against the Japanese yen driven by higher yields in the U.S. 

These scenarios are developed solely for supervisory stress testing purposes and do not 

represent economic forecasts by the Board. 

D.  FR Y-14 Reporting Requirements 

The proposal would seek to make changes to the FR Y-14A/Q/M reports to remove items 

and documentation requirements that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test.  

The proposal would also seek to collect additional data that would support the proposed 

supervisory models and that would improve risk capture.  Appendix B contains a summary of the 

proposed changes to the data collection.  The removal of the supporting documentation 

15 

 
 
requirement is expected to reduce submitted documentation by over 10,000 pages, on average, 

for each firm subject to the requirement.  

E.  Analysis of Proposed Model and Scenario Changes 

In aggregate, the stress test model and scenario changes are not expected to materially 

change capital requirements for firms subject to the supervisory stress test, across various stress 

scenarios and jump-off conditions at the start of the test.  For instance, relative to the results from 

the 2024 and 2025 stress testing cycles, staff analysis indicates that the proposed changes could 

have reduced aggregate stress capital buffer requirements by approximately 23 basis points, on 

average (41 basis points in 2024 and 5 basis points in 2025), or approximately 2.2 percent of 

current required common equity tier 1 capital.  The analysis estimates that the proposed model 

changes would reduce stress capital buffer requirements by approximately 13 basis points and 

that the proposed revisions to the global market shock scenario design would reduce stress 

capital buffer requirements by approximately 10 basis points.  For U.S. GSIBs, the analysis 

estimates a decline of 25 basis points in stress capital buffer requirements. 

Overall, the decrease in capital requirements observed across the 2024 and 2025 cycles is 

negligible, and the estimated impact of these changes remains highly sensitive to the stress test 

scenario and firm-specific data for each year.  Looking ahead, while the precise impact will vary 

each year based on stress test scenarios and specific firm data, our analysis across a range of 

conditions shows that capital requirements should remain essentially unchanged.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

For the reasons discussed above, staff recommend that the Board approve the attached 

draft notices.  Staff also recommend that the Board authorize staff to make technical, non-

substantive changes to the attached materials prior to publication. 

23  The table in Appendix A presents the impact of the proposal in terms of changes in the 
estimated capital ratio decline in the stress test, which is translated to an impact on firm’s stress 
capital buffer requirements, accounting for the 2.5 percent floor and the dividend add-on.

Appendix A: Proposed Model Changes and Estimated Impact 

The proposal would publish for public comment several proposed changes to the models, relative 
to the models used in the 2025 cycle.  A brief summary of these changes is included below. 

•  Credit Risk Models:  

o  The proposal would include changes to several retail models to enhance and, in some 
cases, simplify them, including updates to reduce regional variation and eliminate 
cliff effects in projected loss rates that could unduly affect the allocation of credit. 
o  The proposal would include changes to the corporate model suite, including enhanced 

and simplified probability of default and loss-given-default models. 
o  The proposal would also make minor changes to other credit risk models.  

•  Securities Models: 

o  The proposal would implement a new framework for calculating losses on other than 

temporarily impaired securities. 

o  The proposal would enhance the conceptual soundness of the securities loss model by 
incorporating more appropriate reinvestment assumptions on different securities.  For 
consistency, this modeling approach would be used for securities interest income.  

•  Market Risk Models: The proposal would simplify the GMS framework by reducing the 

number of shocks and reducing the liquidity horizons over which shocks are calculated. The 
proposal would modify the exclusion list for a firm’s largest counterparty. 

•  Operational Risk (Ops Risk) Model: The proposal would discontinue the macroeconomic 
regression, which would mitigate certain assumptions regarding the timing of operational 
loss events. The proposal would also improve the measure of operational risk exposure. 

•  Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) Models: The proposal would fully replace the current 
suite of PPNR models.  The new models would better reflect the structure of firms’ assets 
and liabilities and would reduce the volatility of PPNR projections.

Appendix B: Summary of Proposed FR Y-14 Revisions 

•  Supporting Documentation -- Firms are required to provide qualitative information on the 
methodologies used to develop their projections and any other analysis that supports their 
FR Y-14A submissions.  

o  As the FR Y-14 has matured, much of the supporting documentation is not needed 

by supervisors to assess firms’ submissions.  To ensure that the FR Y-14A 
requirements capture information used by supervisors and to reduce reporting 
burden, the proposal would remove the supporting documentation requirements 
from the FR Y-14A.  

o  Supervisors could still request similar information from firms through supervisory 
channels, as deemed appropriate and on a targeted basis, in support of the annual 
capital plan review. 

•  Home Equity Loan-Level Data -- The Board has identified several items on the FR Y-

14M that are not needed to assess a home equity line of credit’s risk characteristics or for 
stress test modeling.  Therefore, to maintain appropriate risk coverage and reduce 
reporting burden, the proposal would retire approximately 20 fields from the FR Y-14M. 

•  Private Equity Exposures -- Beginning with the 2025 supervisory stress test, losses on 
private equity exposures are calculated using the macroeconomic scenario and not the 
global market shock.  To capture data in a manner that aligns better with this new 
treatment, the proposal would include minor revisions for reporting private equity 
exposures and associated hedges. 

•  Hedges -- To broaden the consideration of hedges in the calculation of stress test losses, 
the proposal would include revisions to capture more data on various types of hedges.  

•  Revenue and Loss Sharing Agreements -- To enhance the Board’s adjustment for credit 

card revenue and loss sharing agreements, the proposal would collect additional 
information associated with these agreements.  

•  Other Revisions -- The proposal would also include other minor revisions to reduce 

regulatory reporting burden, align with the proposal’s changes to the stress test timeline, 
and to clarify the instructions.

Introduction  

In December 2024, the Board announced that it would propose significant changes to 

improve the transparency of the supervisory stress test and reduce the volatility of resulting 

capital requirements.1  The Board noted it planned to propose changes to disclose and seek 

public comment on the models that determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under 

stress and ensure that the public can comment on the hypothetical scenarios used annually for the 

test, before the scenarios are finalized.  With this proposal, the Board is inviting public comment 

on the comprehensive model documentation for the 2026 stress test, as well as proposed changes 

to the models relative to the 2025 stress test.  The comprehensive model documentation is 

available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  The Board 

is inviting comment on the proposed scenarios for the 2026 stress test through a separate notice. 

This proposal seeks to improve the transparency and public accountability of the 

supervisory stress test, while ensuring that the stress test remains an effective tool for 

understanding and assessing risk and retaining appropriate risk sensitivity and risk capture in 

capital requirements.   

The Board periodically reviews its regulations, including transparency efforts 

surrounding its regulations, to ensure they continue to achieve their goals in an effective and 

efficient manner.  In addition to the changes discussed herein, the Board is also considering the 

effectiveness of its regulatory capital and capital planning requirements for large firms to ensure 

they remain cohesive and effective, maintain the resilience of the banking sector, and minimize

bcreg20241223a.htm.  In February 2025, the Board reiterated its previous announcement that it would begin the 
public comment process on changes to the supervisory stress test.  See Board, Press Release (Feb. 5, 2025),

any unnecessary burden.  If appropriate, the Board will make changes to its rules through the 

public notice and comment process.   

Question 1: The Board seeks comment on all aspects of the proposal.  What, if any, other 

elements of the supervisory stress test framework should the Board consider amending to 

improve the transparency, public accountability, and effectiveness of the supervisory 

stress test?  For example, the Board could instead transliterate the models used to 

conduct the stress test and codify these transliterations in its regulations.  What would be 

the advantages and disadvantages of this approach or other approaches the Board could 

consider?  

II. 

Background on Stress Testing Framework, Stress Test Models, and Scenario Design 

Framework 

A.  Stress Testing Framework 

Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

(Dodd-Frank Act) in the wake of the 2007–09 financial crisis.2  Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank 

Act, as amended by section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer 

Protection Act,3 requires the Board to establish enhanced prudential standards for nonbank 

financial companies supervised by the Board and bank holding companies with $250 billion or 

more in total consolidated assets.4  The purpose of these enhanced prudential standards is to 

2 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).  

3 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).  

4 See 12 U.S.C. 5365(a).  In addition, the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 provides the Board with 
broad discretionary authority to set minimum capital levels for state member banks and certain affiliates of insured 
depository institutions, including holding companies, supervised by the Board.  See 12 U.S.C. 3902(1); 3907(a); 
3909(a).  Under section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (Bank Holding Company Act), the Board 
may issue such regulations and orders relating to capital requirements of bank holding companies as may be 
necessary for the Board to carry out the purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act.  12 U.S.C. 1844(b).  Foreign 
banking organizations with a U.S. branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary are made subject by 
the International Banking Act of 1978 (International Banking Act) to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company

prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the 

material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial 

institutions.   

Section 165(i)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Board to conduct an annual 

supervisory stress test of nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board and bank holding 

companies with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets to evaluate whether the firm has 

the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse 

economic conditions.5  Section 401(e) of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and 

Consumer Protection Act requires the Board to conduct periodic stress tests for bank holding 

companies with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.6  Section 

165(i)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Board to publish a summary of the supervisory 

stress test results.7  In 2012, the Board adopted a final rule implementing the stress test 

requirements established in the Dodd-Frank Act.8   

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in 

total consolidated assets, as well as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board, to 

conduct company-run stress tests on a periodic basis.9  Under the Board’s rules, firms subject to 

Act in the same manner as bank holding companies, see 12 U.S.C. 3106; therefore, the Board is also authorized 
under section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act to impose these requirements on those foreign banking 
organizations, including on their U.S. operations.  Similarly, with regard to savings and loan holding companies, 
section 10(g) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act authorizes the Board to issue such regulations and orders relating to 
capital requirements as the Board deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Home Owners’ 
Loan Act.  See 12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1).

Category I, II, or III standards must conduct company-run stress tests.10  Company-run stress 

tests provide forward-looking information to supervisors to assist in their overall assessments of 

a firm’s capital adequacy, help to better identify downside risks and the potential impact of 

adverse outcomes on the firm‘s capital adequacy, and assist in achieving the financial stability 

goals of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Further, the company-run stress tests help improve firms’ stress 

testing practices with respect to their own internal assessments of capital adequacy and overall 

capital planning.   

Each June, the Board publishes the results of its annual supervisory stress test, including 

each firm’s projected capital ratios, pre-tax net income, losses, revenues, and expenses, under 

hypothetical, severely adverse economic and financial conditions.11  These disclosures provide 

the public with valuable information about each firm’s financial condition and the ability of each 

firm to absorb losses considering a stressful economic environment.   

Following the 2007–09 financial crisis, the Board also made changes to its capital rule to 

address weaknesses observed during the crisis.12  These changes included the establishment of a 

minimum common equity tier 1 capital requirement and a fixed capital conservation buffer equal 

10 See 84 FR 59032 (Nov. 1, 2019); 12 CFR 238.142; 12 CFR 252.53.  State member banks with average total 
consolidated assets of greater than $250 billion must also conduct company-run stress tests. 12 CFR 252.13. 
11 A firm subject to Category I through III standards must participate in the supervisory stress test every year, while 
a firm subject to Category IV standards is generally required to participate only every other year.  See 12 CFR 
217.2; 12 CFR 238.10; 12 CFR 252.5; 84 FR 59032 (Nov. 1, 2019).  In 2019, the Board adopted rules establishing 
four categories of prudential standards for U.S. banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $100 billion 
or more and foreign banking organizations with combined U.S. assets of $100 billion or more.  See 12 CFR 217.2; 
12 CFR 238.10; 12 CFR 252.5; 84 FR 59032 (Nov. 1, 2019).  Category I standards apply to U.S. GSIBs and their 
depository institution subsidiaries.  Category II standards apply to banking organizations with at least $700 billion in 
total consolidated assets or at least $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity and their depository institution 
subsidiaries.  Category III standards apply to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of at least $250 
billion or at least $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet 
exposure and their depository institution subsidiaries.  Category IV standards apply to banking organizations with 
total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion that do not meet the thresholds for a higher category and their 
depository institution subsidiaries.

to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.13  Large firms also became subject to a countercyclical 

capital buffer requirement, and the largest and most systemically important firms—global 

systemically important bank holding companies, or GSIBs—became subject to an additional 

capital buffer based on a measure of their systemic risk, the GSIB surcharge.14  In 2020, the 

Board adopted the stress capital buffer requirement for certain firms.15  Because a firm’s stress 

capital buffer requirement is informed by the firm’s performance under the hypothetical 

economic conditions modeled by the supervisory stress test, each firm’s stress capital buffer 

requirement is tailored to its risk profile.   

Supervisory stress testing and stronger capital requirements have significantly improved 

the resilience of the U.S. banking system.  Since 2009, the common equity capital ratios of firms 

subject to the test have more than doubled, with common equity capital of such firms increasing 

by over $1 trillion.16  Since 2020, the supervisory stress test results have also informed a firm’s 

stress capital buffer requirement.  Greater transparency would allow firms to better understand 

the capital requirements associated with investment and expansion of different business lines and 

would facilitate more effective long-term capital planning.  This, in turn, could enhance firms’ 

ability to supply credit to households and businesses, ultimately supporting economic growth and 

financial stability. 

13 See 78 FR 62018 (Oct. 11, 2013); 12 CFR 217.11. 

14 See 80 FR 49082 (Aug. 14, 2015). 

15 In 2020, the Board finalized a rule to integrate supervisory stress test results into the capital framework, through 
the stress capital buffer requirement.  See 85 FR 15576 (Mar. 18, 2020).  The stress capital buffer requirement is 
calculated as the difference between a firm’s starting and lowest projected common equity tier 1 capital ratio under 
the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, 
expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.  See 12 CFR 225.8(f); 12 CFR 238.170(f).  The stress capital 
buffer requirement framework generally applies to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.

B.  Prior Supervisory Stress Disclosures and Policy Statements 

In addition to the annual stress test results disclosure, the Board has historically published 

some information about the supervisory stress test scenarios and models.  

Scenarios 

The Board’s stress test rules provide that the Board will notify firms, by no later than 

February 15 of each year, of the scenarios that the Board will apply to conduct its annual 

supervisory stress test and that firms must use to conduct their company-run stress tests.17  The 

Board also provides a narrative description of the scenarios no later than February 15 of each 

calendar year.18   

In 2013, the Board increased the transparency of the scenarios by finalizing the Policy 

Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing (Scenario Design Policy 

Statement), which articulated the Board’s approach to scenario design for the supervisory and 

company-run stress tests, outlining the characteristics of the stress test scenarios, and explaining 

the considerations and procedures that underlie the formulation of these scenarios. 19  The 

Scenario Design Policy Statement also described the baseline and severely adverse scenarios, the 

Board’s approach for developing these two macroeconomic scenarios, and the approach for 

developing any additional components of the stress test scenarios.  The Scenario Design Policy 

Statement explained that the severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect conditions that have 

characterized post-war U.S. recessions (the recession approach).  Historically, recessions have 

17 See 12 CFR 238.132(b); 12 CFR 238.143(b); 12 CFR 252.14(b); 12 CFR 252.44(b); 12 CFR 252.54(b). 

18 See, e.g., Board, 2025 Stress Test Scenarios (Feb. 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-
stress-test-scenarios-20250205.pdf.  

19 12 CFR Part 252, Appendix A. 

Page 10 of 294 

 
 
typically featured increases in the unemployment rate, contractions in aggregate incomes and 

economic activity, and declines in inflation and interest rates.   

In the 2013 Scenario Design Policy Statement, the Board explained that, in light of the 

typical co-movement of measures of economic activity during economic downturns, such as the 

unemployment rate and gross domestic product, the Board would first specify a path for the 

unemployment rate and then develops paths for other measures of activity broadly consistent 

with the course of the unemployment rate in developing the severely adverse scenario.  The 2013 

Scenario Design Policy Statement also stated that economic variables included in the scenarios 

may change over time, and that the Board may augment the recession approach with certain 

salient risks, which would involve incorporating features that address aspects of the current 

economic or financial market environment that represent higher-than-normal risks to the 

condition of the banking system.   

In 2019, the Board updated the Scenario Design Policy Statement, which increased the 

transparency and predictability of the scenarios by allowing for a smaller-than-usual increase in 

unemployment if the stress test were to occur during an economic downturn, a change that would 

pass through to reduced severity of other key scenario variables due to the deference given to 

historical correlations.  The 2019 update also introduced a formula with countercyclical features 

to guide the evolution of the ratio of housing prices to disposable income in the scenario, which 

provided more predictability in the way that the stress test would treat business lines affected by 

changes in house prices.  However, the Board believes that the design of scenarios could be 

made more transparent and predictable by providing additional guides for certain 

macroeconomic variables, and by disclosing additional detailed information on the methodology 

Page 11 of 294 

 
used to create the global market shock component of the severely adverse scenario, as described 

below. 

a. 

Trading and Counterparty Components 

For a subset of firms, the severely adverse scenario also includes two additional 

components: the global market shock component and the largest counterparty default 

component.20  The global market shock component is a set of hypothetical shocks to a large set 

of risk factors reflecting general market distress and heightened uncertainty.  A firm with 

significant trading activity must consider the global market shock component as part of its 

severely adverse scenario and recognize associated losses in the first quarter of the projection 

horizon.21  The global market shock component is applied to asset positions held by the firms on 

a given as-of date.22  In addition, for certain large and highly interconnected firms, the same 

global market shock component is applied to counterparty exposures under the largest 

counterparty default component.23  The largest counterparty default component is intended to 

assess the potential losses and capital impact associated with the default of the largest 

counterparty of each applicable firm, and the as-of date aligns with that of the global market 

shock component. 

20 See 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(2)(i).  For more information on the scenarios and components, 
see Board, 2025 Stress Test Scenarios (Feb. 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-stress-
test-scenarios-20250205.pdf. 

21 The global market shock component applies to firms subject to Category I, II, and III standards that have 
aggregate trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more, or trading assets and liabilities equal to or greater than 
10 percent of total consolidated assets.  See 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(2)(i). 
22 Under the Board’s current stress test rules, the global market shock as-of date must occur between October 1 and 
March 1.  See 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.14(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(2)(i).   

23 The largest counterparty default component generally applies to all firms subject to the global market shock 
component, as well as firms with substantial processing and custodial operations. 

Page 12 of 294 

 
 
The design and specification of the global market shock component differs from the 

design and specification of the severely adverse scenario in several respects.  First, in alignment 

with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), profits and losses from trading 

and counterparty credit positions are measured in mark-to-market accounting terms in the global 

market shock, while revenues and losses from traditional banking activities, as generated under 

macroeconomic scenarios, are generally measured using the accrual accounting method.  Second, 

the timing of loss recognition differs between the global market shock and the severely adverse 

macroeconomic scenario.  The global market shock affects the mark-to-market value of trading 

positions and counterparty credit losses in the first quarter of the severely adverse scenario.  This 

timing is based on an observation that market dislocations can happen rapidly and unpredictably 

at any time under stressed conditions.  In addition, the severely adverse scenario is applied as of 

December 31 of each year (the jump-off date), whereas the global market shock as-of date 

changes every year (within the window specified in the Board’s stress test rules) and does not 

necessarily coincide with the year-end.  This timing is also based on a scenario assumption that 

market dislocations can happen rapidly and unpredictably at any time during the scenario 

horizon.  Recognizing the global market shock in the first quarter helps ensure that potential 

losses from trading and counterparty exposures are incorporated into firms’ capital ratios in each 

quarter of the severely adverse scenario. 

Models 

Prior to 2019, the annual stress test results disclosure document contained an appendix 

describing the Board’s supervisory stress test models.24  In 2019, the Board increased the 

24 See, e.g., Board, 2018 Supervisory Stress Test Results (Jun. 2018), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-dfast-methodology-results-20180621.pdf.  

Page 13 of 294 

 
 
transparency of the supervisory stress test models by finalizing the Stress Testing Policy 

Statement25 and the Enhanced Disclosure of the Models Used in the Federal Reserve’s 

Supervisory Stress Test (Enhanced Model Disclosure).26  The Stress Testing Policy Statement 

describes the Board’s policies and procedures that guide the development, implementation, and 

validation of the models.27  The Stress Testing Policy Statement also describes the Board’s 

principles for stress test model design, namely that the system of models used in the supervisory 

stress test should result in projections that are (1) independent of firm projections; (2) forward-

looking in that they project future losses and revenue; (3) consistent and comparable across 

firms; (4) generated from simple approaches, where appropriate; (5) robust and stable; 

(6) conservative; and (7) able to capture the effect of severe economic stress.  The Board has 

developed stress test models in accordance with these principles, which are the foundation for 

the stress test modeling decisions described in the comprehensive documentation of the 

supervisory stress test models that the Board is publishing in conjunction with this proposal.   

The Enhanced Model Disclosure supplemented prior public descriptions of the stress test 

models by providing some information about their structure and by including a list of key 

variables that influence the results of each model.28  However, the Board believes more detailed 

information, beyond what is in the current Enhanced Model Disclosure, would improve the 

ability of firms to accurately assess how changes in their business activities might impact their

Page 14 of 294 

 
 
supervisory stress test results and, relatedly, their stress capital buffer requirements and overall 

capital requirements.   

C.  Supervisory Stress Test Modeling Framework 

The Board’s stress test models take macroeconomic variables from the Board’s severely 

adverse scenario and firm data as inputs to produce each firm’s projected capital ratios over a 

nine-quarter horizon.  The projected common equity tier 1 capital ratio is used to inform each 

firm’s stress capital buffer requirement, which becomes part of a firm’s capital conservation 

buffer.  

The stress test models are intended to capture how a firm’s regulatory capital would be 

affected by the macroeconomic and financial conditions described in the stress test scenarios, 

given the characteristics of the firm’s business model and balance sheet composition.  The Board 

uses a variety of statistical modeling techniques to produce the stress test results, including 

multivariate regression, which uses relationships in historical data to produce projections of a 

variable (such as a loss given default).  These models are represented by a set of formulas and 

coefficients that produce the projections. 

The Board estimates the effect of the severely adverse scenario on the regulatory capital 

ratios of firms by projecting revenues, expenses, and losses for each firm over a nine-quarter 

projection horizon (projection horizon).  The projection horizon spans nine quarters to ensure 

that the firms can continue to provide credit and serve as financial intermediaries despite several 

quarters of adverse economic conditions, as well as to promote the forward-looking nature of 

capital planning by firms.   

Projected net income, adjusted for the effect of taxes, is combined with assumptions 

regarding capital actions and other changes to regulatory capital to produce post-stress capital 

Page 15 of 294 

 
ratios.  The Board’s approach to modeling supervisory stress test results, including the 

calculation of post-stress capital ratios, is generally in alignment with U.S. GAAP and the 

regulatory capital framework.29  However, the stress test models may deviate from U.S. GAAP 

and the regulatory capital framework, as circumstances warrant. 

The Board established the Stress Testing Policy Statement modeling principles to ensure 

that the models are well suited for their purpose in the regulatory framework.  In some cases, the 

Board’s adherence to the principles limits modeling choices and results in certain common 

limitations across similarly constructed component models.  For instance, consistent with the 

principles of independence, consistency and comparability, and simplicity, models are not 

designed to capture all firm-specific nuances, future strategic initiatives, or planned capital 

actions.  Additionally, models may be limited by their reliance on historic relationships and by 

the nature of the data captured in firms’ regulatory reports.  Detailed assumptions and limitations 

for the models are discussed in the comprehensive documentation, which is available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.   

Under the Stress Testing Policy Statement, the Board’s projections also assume that a 

firm’s balance sheet remains unchanged throughout the projection horizon.30  This assumption 

seeks to help ensure that a firm cannot “shrink to health” and that it remains sufficiently 

capitalized to accommodate credit demand in a severe downturn.  

D.  Stress Test Models 

The Board’s stress test models comprise twenty-one component models that, when 

aggregated, produce projected regulatory capital ratios for each firm (see Table 1 below).  The 

29  See generally 12 CFR Part 217. 

30  See 12 CFR 252, Appendix B, section 2.7. 

Page 16 of 294 

 
 
models can be grouped into four categories: credit risk, market risk, net revenue, and 

aggregation.  Credit risk models capture losses associated with retail and wholesale loans that are 

held at amortized cost.  Market risk models capture losses associated with trading and 

counterparty exposures, securities, and other assets held at fair value.  Net revenue models 

capture income and expenses, including those related to operational risk, earned or incurred by a 

firm.  Positive pre-provision net revenue offsets credit and market risk losses in the calculation of 

a firm’s pre-tax net income.  Aggregation models calculate a firm’s pre-tax net income, which is 

then adjusted for other elements such as taxes and regulatory capital deductions to arrive at the 

projection of a firm’s regulatory capital, which is used to calculate a firm’s projected capital 

ratios.  Additional detail about these component models is provided in Section III.A of this 

Supplementary Information and the comprehensive model documentation available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.31

E.  Summary of the Proposal 

Description 

Projects change in regulatory capital and risk-weighted 
assets 

The Board is publishing comprehensive documentation on the stress test models on the 

Board’s website, at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  

This model documentation contains information on the models that together produce the results 

of the supervisory stress test.  The model documentation includes the equations, variables, and 

coefficients used in each model (where applicable); assumptions and limitations of each model; 

rationales for modeling decisions; and discussions of alternative models.  Section VIII.A of this 

Supplementary Information summarizes changes to the models, relative to the 2025 stress test, 

that the Board plans to implement in the 2026 stress test cycle; section VIII.B of this 

Supplementary Information contains an analysis of the potential effects of these proposed model 

changes.  Detailed documentation on these changes is also provided on the Board’s website, at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  As part of this 

proposal, the Board is inviting public comment on the stress test models and these changes.  

In addition, the Board is proposing to codify an enhanced disclosure process that would 

build on the previous efforts that the Board has made to increase the transparency and public 

accountability of the supervisory stress test.  Under this enhanced disclosure process, the Board 

would annually publish comprehensive model documentation on the stress test models, invite 

public comment on any material changes that the Board seeks to make to those models, and 

annually publish the stress test scenarios for comment.  The Board would also commit to 

responding to substantive public comments on any material model changes before implementing 

Page 19 of 294 

 
 
them.  The proposal would revise the Stress Testing Policy Statement to align with this enhanced 

disclosure process, as well as to amend the Board’s general policy related to disclosing additional 

information directly to a firm about that firm’s supervisory stress test results.  To accommodate 

the annual comment process on the scenarios, the proposal would shift the jump-off date of the 

supervisory and company-run stress tests from December 31 to September 30.  

Additionally, this proposal would amend the Scenario Design Policy Statement in several 

ways.  The Board would include in the Scenario Design Policy Statement detailed descriptions of 

additional guides that are used to inform the Board’s choice of the values of the scenario 

variables along their scenario paths.  The guides are designed to balance the competing 

objectives of predictability and transparency, on the one hand, with the severity and relevance of 

the macroeconomic and financial market scenarios, on the other hand.  Most of the proposed 

guides also incorporate features similar to the range of options in the existing unemployment 

guide or the automatic adjustment of the house price path to current housing market conditions in 

the existing house price guide.  This approach would allow the Board to continue to adjust the 

severity of those variables as necessary to avoid inducing greater procyclicality in the financial 

system and macroeconomy. 

Similarly, the Board is proposing to incorporate additional information into the Scenario 

Design Policy Statement about the framework used to create the global market shock component 

of the severely adverse scenario.  This information includes, but is not limited to, details on the 

logic underlying the severity of the shocks and a description of the processes used to generate the 

shock values.  The Board is also proposing to update the global market shock methodology to 

simplify the scenario and better align certain elements of the global market shock with the nature 

of an “instantaneous” shock.  The proposal would also make revisions to the stress test rules to 

Page 20 of 294 

 
improve the risk capture of the supervisory stress test by widening the as-of date window for the 

global market shock.  

Finally, the proposal would make changes to the FR Y-14A/Q/M reports to remove items 

and documentation requirements that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test, 

as well as to collect additional data to improve risk capture. 

F.  Purpose of the Proposal 

The purpose of this proposal is to provide the public with more information about the 

stress test models and scenarios and to help ensure that the public has an opportunity to comment 

on the models and scenarios.  While the Board has increased the transparency of the stress test 

models over time, disclosing additional information about the stress test models and their 

underlying methodologies will further increase transparency and improve public accountability.  

Publishing detailed descriptions of the stress test models for comment, as well as 

committing to future enhanced disclosures, has benefits.  First, the increase in transparency 

would increase public accountability and instill confidence in the fairness of the supervisory 

stress tests.  Second, the disclosure process would create a new mechanism for obtaining 

feedback from the public, including academics, financial analysts, and firms, on the design and 

specifications of the models, which should lead to model improvements.  Third, a firm would 

have a better sense of how its risk profile would factor into its stress capital buffer requirement, 

which would reduce the likelihood of unanticipated stress test results and allow for better capital 

and business planning by firms.  Finally, the public disclosure of additional information about 

supervisory stress tests should strengthen market discipline, because investors, counterparties, 

Page 21 of 294 

 
and rating agencies would be able to better assess a firm’s risk profile.33  The costs and benefits 

of this proposal are described more thoroughly in Section X of this Supplementary Information.   

With respect to the proposed amendments to the Scenario Design Policy Statement, this 

proposal also builds on the contents of the current Scenario Design Policy Statement and would 

amend it to provide additional transparency, public accountability, and predictability in the 

variable paths.  The changes would support the Board in developing scenarios, inviting comment 

on those scenarios, incorporating input from commenters, and maintaining the current schedule 

for release of the final scenarios.  Despite the increased predictability in the scenarios, the new 

framework would remain flexible enough to suitably assess whether firms can maintain an 

adequate amount of loss-absorbing capital to stay above minimum regulatory requirements and 

continue financial intermediation during periods of stress, as well as adjust features that might 

add to existing procyclicality in the financial system, as appropriate.  In practice, the scenarios 

resulting from the revised framework are expected to remain consistent with the current Scenario 

Design Policy Statement and should not result, on average over a typical business cycle, in 

materially different scenarios than would have been designed previously. 

Additionally, the proposal would simplify the design of the global market shock 

component and incorporate additional information on the development process into the Scenario 

Design Policy Statement, which outlines the Board’s approaches to designing market shocks, 

including important considerations for scenario design, possible approaches to developing 

scenarios, and a development strategy for implementing the preferred approach.  Taken together, 

these changes would improve transparency, public accountability, and predictability of the

supervisory scenarios, while ensuring the supervisory stress test’s ability to capture changes in 

the risks in the financial industry over time.  

III.  Overview of the Stress Test Modeling Framework 

As summarized in Section II.D of this Supplementary Information, the Board estimates 

the effect of the scenarios on the regulatory capital ratios of firms participating in the stress test 

by projecting net income and other components of regulatory capital for each firm over a nine-

quarter projection horizon.  To do so, the Board uses twenty-one component models, the 

macroeconomic variables from the Board’s severely adverse scenario, and firm data.  This 

section provides an overview of the component models the Board used to run the 2025 

supervisory stress test.  See Table 1 in Section II.D of this Supplementary Information.   

A.  Supervisory Stress Test Models 

The Board calculates projected pre-tax net income by combining projections of pre-

provision net revenue,34 provisions for credit losses,35 and other gains or losses.36  Each 

component of pre-tax net income is described below.  

Pre-provision Net Revenue 

Pre-provision net revenue is defined as net interest income (interest income minus 

interest expense) plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense.  Consistent with U.S. 

GAAP, these projections include projected losses due to operational risk events and expenses 

34 Pre-provision net revenue includes, among other items, income from mortgage servicing rights, losses from 
operational risk events, and other real estate owned costs. 

35 For firms that have adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, the Federal Reserve incorporates its 
projection of expected credit losses on securities in the allowance for credit losses, in accordance with Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326).  See FASB ASU No. 2016-
13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” 

36 Other gains or losses include losses on held-for-sale loans, loans measured under the fair-value option, and loan 
hedges. 

Page 23 of 294 

 
 
related to the disposition of other real estate owned.37  The Board projects most components of 

pre-provision net revenue using models that relate specific revenue and non-provision-related 

expenses to the characteristics of firms and to macroeconomic variables.  These include eight 

components of interest income, seven components of interest expense, six components of 

noninterest income, and three components of noninterest expense.  The Board separately projects 

losses from operational risk and other real estate owned expenses.  Operational risk is defined as 

“the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 

from external events.”38  Other real estate owned expenses are expenses related to the disposition 

of real estate owned properties and stem from losses on first-lien mortgages. 

Loan Losses and Provisions on Loans Measured at Amortized Cost  

The Board typically projects losses using one of two modeling approaches: the expected-

loss approach or the net charge-off approach.  Generally, under the expected loss approach, 

expected losses are estimated by projecting the probability of default, loss given default, and 

exposure at default for each quarter of the projection horizon.  Expected losses in each quarter 

are the product of these three components.  Under the net charge-off approach, losses are 

projected using historical behavior of net charge-offs as a function of macroeconomic and 

financial market conditions and loan portfolio characteristics.39 

The Board estimates losses for loans measured at amortized cost separately for different 

categories of loans, based on the type of obligor, collateral, and loan structure.  The individual 

37 However, pre-provision net revenue projections do not include debt valuation adjustments, which are not included 
in regulatory capital. 

38 12 CFR 217.101 “Operational risk.” 

39 Entire loans or portions of loans may be charged off if a firm believes that the loan will not be repaid.  If an 
amount that is charged off is ultimately repaid by the borrower, then that repaid amount is added to a firm’s income 
as a recovery.  Net charge-offs are total charge-offs less any recoveries. 

Page 24 of 294 

 
 
loan types modeled can broadly be divided into (1) retail loans, including various types of 

residential mortgages, credit cards, student loans, auto loans, small business loans, and other 

consumer loans; and (2) wholesale loans, such as commercial and industrial loans and 

commercial real estate loans.  For most loan types, losses in quarter t are estimated as the product 

of the projected probability of default in quarter t, the loss given default in quarter t, and 

exposure at default in quarter t.  

The probability of default component measures the likelihood that a borrower enters 

default status during a given quarter t.  The other two components capture the lender’s net loss 

on the loan if the borrower enters default.  The loss given default component measures the 

percentage of the loan balance that the lender will not be able to recover after the borrower enters 

default, and the exposure at default component measures the total expected outstanding loan 

balance at the time of default.40     

The Board’s definition of default, for stress test modeling purposes, may vary for 

different types of loans and may differ from general industry definitions or classifications.  The 

Board generally models probability of default as a function of loan characteristics and economic 

conditions.  The Board typically models loss given default based on historical data, and modeling 

approaches vary for different types of loans.  For certain loan types, the Board models loss given 

default as a function of borrower, collateral, or loan characteristics and the macroeconomic 

variables from the supervisory scenarios.  For other loan types, the Board assumes loss given 

default is a fixed percentage of the loan balance for all loans in a category.  The approach to 

40 When applicable, loan loss models may factor in shared-loss agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. 

Page 25 of 294 

 
 
modeling exposure at default also varies by loan type and depends on whether the loan is a term 

loan or a line of credit.   

For certain retail loan categories, projections capture the historical behavior of net 

charge-offs as a function of macroeconomic and financial market conditions and loan portfolio 

characteristics.  The Board then uses these stress test models to project future charge-offs 

consistent with the evolution of macroeconomic conditions under the severely adverse scenario.  

To project losses, the projected net charge-off rate is applied to projected loan balances. 

Losses on loans are then projected to flow into net income through provisions for loan 

and lease losses (for simplicity, provisions for loan losses).  Provisions for loan losses reflect 

funds set aside to cover loan losses that a firm expects to incur in a predetermined future 

window.  Provisions for loan losses feed into the allowance for loan losses, which serves as a 

contra asset on a firm’s balance sheet.  The charged-off amount of a loan reduces the outstanding 

balance of the loan while also reducing the allowance for loan losses (that is, charge-offs do not 

reduce a firm’s total assets).  Generally, provisions for loan losses for each projected quarter in 

the supervisory stress test equal projected losses on loans for the quarter plus the change in the 

allowance for loan losses needed to cover the subsequent four quarters of expected loan losses.  

This calculation incorporates the allowance for loan losses established by the firm as of the 

jump-off date of the stress test exercise.   

Current Expected Credit Losses Framework 

On January 1, 2020, most large and mid-sized U.S. banks adopted the Current Expected 

Credit Losses (CECL) standard for calculating allowances.41  CECL superseded the incurred loss 

41 See FASB ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses 
on Financial Instruments.”  

Page 26 of 294 

 
 
accounting standard, which was a backward-looking measure that enabled firms to calculate 

allowances based on historical loss data and current economic conditions.  CECL, by contrast, is 

a forward-looking measure that requires firms to estimate lifetime losses based on reasonable 

estimates of future economic conditions.  In October 2024, the Board announced that it would 

continue to evaluate future enhancements to the supervisory stress test approach for the 

incorporation of CECL.42  

The Board is not proposing to implement CECL into the supervisory stress testing 

framework as a part of this proposal.  The allowance calculation framework currently used in the 

supervisory stress test is already forward-looking: it projects loan loss provisions four quarters 

ahead.  This approach aligns with the Board’s modeling principle of simplicity as it requires 

fewer assumptions than would be required to determine provisions under CECL.  In addition, in 

aggregate, the cumulative loan loss provisions under the supervisory severely adverse scenario 

are similar to provision projections submitted by the firms that have adopted CECL.  Should the 

Board decide to implement CECL into the supervisory stress testing framework, it would seek 

public comment prior to implementation, as it would likely be a material model change as 

defined in this proposal. 

Question 2: What factors should the Board consider when determining whether to implement 

CECL into the supervisory stress testing framework and why?   

Question 3: What would be the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating CECL into 

the supervisory stress testing framework?

Losses on Loans Measured on a Fair Value Basis 

Certain loans are accounted for on a fair value basis instead of on an amortized cost basis.  

If a loan is accounted for using the fair value option, it is marked to market, and the accounting 

value of the loan changes as a function of changes in market risk factors and fundamentals.  

Similarly, loans that are held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value.  The 

stress test models for these asset classes project gains and losses over the nine-quarter projection 

horizon, net of any hedges, using the scenario-specific path of interest rates and credit spreads.  

The Board uses different models to estimate gains and losses on wholesale loans and retail loans 

that are accounted for on a fair value basis since these loans have different risk characteristics.  

However, these models all generally project gains and losses over the nine-quarter projection 

horizon, net of hedges, by applying the scenario-specific interest rate and credit spread shocks to 

loan yields.  

Losses on Securities 

A firm’s balance sheet typically contains holdings of two types of securities related to 

investment activities: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.  Available-for-sale and held-to-

maturity securities are generally held at fair value and amortized cost, respectively, on a firm’s 

balance sheet.  The Board estimates two types of losses on securities related to investment 

activities.43   

For debt securities classified as available-for-sale, projected fluctuations in the fair value 

of the securities due to changes in interest rates and other factors will result in unrealized gains 

or losses that are recognized in capital for some firms through other comprehensive income.  

43 This portfolio does not include securities held for trading.  Losses on these securities are projected by the Trading 
Profit and Loss Model that projects gains and losses on trading exposures. 

Page 28 of 294 

 
 
Under U.S. GAAP, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reflected 

in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not flow through net income.44  Under the 

regulatory capital rule, accumulated other comprehensive income must be incorporated into 

common equity tier 1 capital for certain firms.  Unrealized gains and losses are calculated as the 

difference between each security’s fair value and its amortized cost.  The amortized cost of each 

available-for-sale debt security is equivalent to the purchase price of the debt security, which is 

periodically adjusted if the debt security was purchased at a price other than par or face value, 

has a principal repayment, or has an impairment recognized in earnings.45   

Credit losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities may be also recorded.  

Except for certain government-backed obligations, both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity 

securities are at risk of incurring credit losses.46  The stress test models project security-level 

credit losses, using as an input the projected fair value for each security over the nine-quarter 

projection horizon under the severely adverse scenario.  Credit losses on securities are included 

in the projection of provisions.   

Projected other comprehensive income gains or losses from available-for-sale debt 

securities are computed directly from the projected change in fair value, taking into account 

credit losses and applicable interest-rate hedges on securities.  All debt securities held in the 

available-for-sale portfolio are subject to other comprehensive income losses.   

44 Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are recognized in net income and affect regulatory capital for all 
firms.  See FASB ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and 
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” 

45 The fair value of each available-for-sale security is projected over the nine quarter projection horizon using either 
a present value calculation, a full revaluation using a security-specific discounted cash flow model, or a duration-
based approach, depending on the asset class. 

46 Certain government-backed securities, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations, U.S. 
government agency or government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, federally backed student loan 
asset-backed securities, and pre-refunded municipal bonds, are assumed not to be subject to credit losses.

Losses on Private Equity Exposures 

The Board projects the value of private equity investments in response to the severely 

adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test.47  The Private Equity Model assigns losses and 

recoveries based on changes in fair value, recognized in net income for all positions, regardless 

of their individual accounting elections.  While U.S. GAAP allows for private equity to be 

carried under a variety of accounting measures, the different accounting methods are generally 

not reflective of fundamental risk differences—fair value is typically realized upon the orderly 

sale of a given private equity investment, irrespective of its accounting treatment during the 

holding period.48 

Losses on Trading Exposures 

The trading stress test models cover a wide range of a firm’s exposure to asset classes 

such as public equity, foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, securitized products, traded 

credit (for example, municipal securities, auction rate securities, corporate credit, and sovereign 

credit), and other fair-value assets.  Loss projections are constructed by applying the market risk 

factor movements specified in the global market shock component49 to market values of firm-

provided positions and risk factor sensitivities.50  The global market shock only applies to a 

subset of firms, as described in Section II.B.a of this Supplementary Information.  In addition, 

47 The Board projects private equity losses only for firms that are required to submit FR Y-14Q, Schedule F.24 
(Private Equity) because private equity exposures are reported on that schedule.  Currently, Schedule F.24 is 
required to be reported by firms subject to Category I through III standards that have, on average, aggregate trading 
assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more, or aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10 percent or more of 
total consolidated assets.  As discussed in Section XI.A of this Supplementary Information, the Board is proposing 
to modify the threshold for Schedule F.24 to align with other banking book schedules.  

48 Unlike a bond or loan, private equity investments generally cannot be redeemed by holding to maturity and are 
therefore fundamentally exposed to market risk at exit. 
49 See Section II.B.a of this Supplementary Information.   

50 The supervisory trading models are also used to calculate gains or losses on firms’ portfolios of hedges on credit 
valuation adjustment exposures. 

Page 30 of 294 

 
 
the global market shock component is applied to firm counterparty exposures to generate losses 

due to changes in credit valuation adjustment, which is a change to the market value of an 

exposure (for example, a derivative) to account for the risk that the counterparty defaults on its 

obligation.  Trading and credit valuation adjustment losses are calculated only for firms subject 

to the global market shock component.  In contrast to the nine-quarter evolution of losses for 

other parts of the supervisory stress test, and as previously described, these losses are estimated 

and applied in the first quarter of the projection horizon.  This timing is based on the observation 

that market dislocations can happen rapidly and unpredictably any time under stress conditions.  

It also ensures that potential losses from trading and counterparty exposures are incorporated into 

a firm’s capital ratio at all points in the projection horizon.  

The Board separately estimates the risk of losses arising from the default of issuers of 

debt securities held for trading.  These losses account for concentration risk in corporate, 

sovereign, agency, and municipal credit positions.  In contrast to the trading losses described 

above, these losses are applied in each of the nine quarters of the projection horizon to capture 

the risk that several quarters of stressful economic conditions may cause additional issuers of 

debt securities to default, which aligns with the Board’s principle of conservatism from the 

Stress Testing Policy Statement.  

Largest Counterparty Default Losses 

The largest counterparty default component is applied to firms with substantial trading or 

custodial operations.  This component captures the risk of loss due to the unexpected default of 

the counterparty whose default on derivatives and securities financing transactions, with 

exposures revalued by applying the global market shock component, would generate the largest 

stressed losses for a firm.  Consistent with the Board’s modeling principles and with the losses 

Page 31 of 294 

 
associated with the global market shock component, losses associated with the largest 

counterparty default component are recognized in the first quarter of the projection horizon. 

Balance Projections and the Calculation of Regulatory Capital Ratios  

As described above, the Board assumes that a firm takes actions to maintain its current 

level of assets, including its investment securities, trading assets, and loans, over the projection 

horizon.  The Board also assumes that a firm’s risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio 

denominators remain unchanged over the projection horizon, except that the Board will account 

for changes primarily related to the calculation of regulatory capital or due to changes to the 

Board’s regulations.51   

The Board includes five regulatory capital ratios in the supervisory stress test: 

(1) common equity tier 1 risk-based capital, (2) tier 1 risk-based capital, (3) total risk-based 

capital, (4) tier 1 leverage, and (5) supplementary leverage.  A firm’s post-stress regulatory 

capital ratios are projected in accordance with the Board’s regulatory capital rule using the 

Board’s projections of pre-tax net income and other scenario-dependent components of the 

regulatory capital ratios.  Pre-tax net income and the other scenario-dependent components of the 

regulatory capital ratios are combined with additional information, including assumptions about 

taxes and capital distributions, to project post-stress measures of regulatory capital.  In those 

calculations, the Board adjusts pre-tax net income to account for taxes and other components of 

net income, such as income attributable to minority interests, to arrive at after-tax net income.  

The Board calculates the change in equity capital over the projection horizon by combining 

projected after-tax net income with changes in other comprehensive income, assumed capital 

51 See 12 CFR 252, Appendix B, section 3.4; Board, Press Release (Mar. 4, 2020), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200304a.htm. 

Page 32 of 294 

 
 
distributions, and other components of equity capital.  The path of regulatory capital measures 

over the projection horizon is calculated by combining the projected change in equity capital 

with the firm’s starting capital position and accounting for other adjustments to regulatory capital 

specified in the Board’s regulatory capital framework.52  The denominator of each firm’s risk-

based capital ratios is based on a firm’s standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted 

assets on the jump-off date of the supervisory stress test, and may change for each quarter of the 

projection horizon to account for adjustments specified in the capital rule (for example, 

adjustments due to the thresholds for deducting certain deferred tax assets). 

B.  Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios 

The Board conducts the supervisory stress test using two scenarios—the baseline and 

severely adverse.  The severely adverse scenario describes a hypothetical set of conditions 

designed to assess the strength and resilience of firms in a severely adverse economic 

environment and includes 28 variables that are disclosed by the Board each year prior to the 

supervisory stress test.  Some variables describe economic developments within the United 

States while others describe developments in foreign countries.53  These variables serve as an 

input to the calculation of supervisory stress test results for all firms.  As discussed above, for a 

subset of firms, the severely adverse scenario also includes two additional components: the 

global market shock component and the largest counterparty default component.  The scenarios 

and associated components are developed solely for supervisory stress testing purposes and do 

not represent economic forecasts of the Board.   

52 The regulatory capital framework specifies that regulatory capital ratios account for items subject to adjustment or 
deduction in regulatory capital, limits the recognition of certain assets that are less loss-absorbing, and imposes other 
restrictions.  See generally 12 CFR Part 217. 
53 For a description of the macroeconomic variables applicable to the 2025 supervisory stress test, see Board, 2025 
Stress Test Scenarios (Feb. 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-stress-test-scenarios-
20250205.pdf.

Geographic Variation of Macroeconomic Variables  

While the Board projects the paths of macroeconomic variables at the national level, the 

Board uses regional-level (that is, state- and/or county-level) macroeconomic variables in the 

stress test models to project losses on certain loans held for investment at amortized cost.54  In 

general, model outputs are demonstrably impacted by the macroeconomic environment, as both 

probability of default and loss given default increase during periods of economic stress.  

Importantly, the macroeconomic environment can also vary notably across geography, in 

addition to across time.  For instance, during the 2007–2009 crisis period, housing prices fell 

more sharply in certain geographies compared to others.  Accordingly, historical loss rates in 

many loan categories were higher during this period in geographies where housing prices fell 

more sharply. 

Therefore, to account for the impacts of different macroeconomic environments across 

geographies on historical loan performance, the Board calibrates model parameters in certain 

stress test models using regional macroeconomic variables as opposed to national 

macroeconomic variables.  For example, the unemployment rate used in an applicable model 

may be the state level unemployment rate, while the house price index values used in the model 

may be the county-level house price indices or, in the case of loans in counties where a house 

price index is not projected, a state-level house price index.55  Analysis performed by the Board 

demonstrates that a certain model’s statistical fit and sensitivity to the macroeconomic 

environment may perform better when using regional-level variables compared to when using 

54 Specifically, the Board uses regional-level macroeconomic variables in the First Lien Model, the Home Equity 
Model, the Credit Card Model, the Auto Model, and the Commercial Real Estate Model. 
55 Certain variables do not vary based on geography.  For example, interest rates are typically set by national and not 
regional markets.  For these variables, the Board uses the national-level paths in the models.  

Page 34 of 294 

 
 
only national-level variables.  The use of regional-level variables is described in each applicable 

model section of the comprehensive model documentation.  

However, because the severely adverse scenario only includes national-level variable 

paths, the Board derives the paths of regional-level variables from the paths of national-level 

variables.  The Board employs a simple approach to calculating the paths of regional-level 

variables in that these variables have the same percentage change (in the case of an index 

variable) or level change (in the case of non-index variables) as the national-level variables, but 

the starting points are the regional-level values, not the national-level values.  For example, the 

projected path of the house price index is assumed to have the same percentage change in a given 

quarter as the percentage change of the national house price index,56 and the projected path of 

unemployment rate is assumed to have the same level change in a given quarter as the level 

change of the national unemployment rate.57  The use of percentage changes for home price 

indices and level changes for unemployment rates avoids accentuating differences in the 

macroeconomic environment observed immediately prior to the beginning of the scenario, which 

could lead to large discrepancies in projected variable paths across geographies during the 

severely adverse scenario. 

These simple, uniform policies for allocating changes to the national macroeconomic 

environment at the regional level ensure that loans to borrowers in certain geographies are not 

unduly favored or penalized.  While it is plausible that certain geographies may experience more 

volatility than others in terms of the macroeconomic environment, the Board does not estimate 

56 The house price index used in the supervisory stress test scenarios is set to be equal to 100 in January 2000.  This 
choice of index month is arbitrary and does not reflect any underlying economic importance of this period. 

57 For example, if the national unemployment rate increases by 0.5 percentage points in a given quarter, the state-
level unemployment rate would be projected to increase by 0.5 percentage points in that quarter as well. 

Page 35 of 294 

 
 
such volatility to differentiate scenarios across geography, to avoid making assumptions about 

the severity of a hypothetical recession across different regions. 

The Board also uses historical regional data to produce model projections.  While the 

regional scenarios are projected based on the national path, the Board retains variation in the 

historical regional macroeconomic variables.58  The Board may also use historical regional 

macroeconomic variables in the models to calculate the appreciation in house prices since 

origination (which may be needed to calculate loan-to-value ratios), or the Board may use 

regional macroeconomic variables to calculate year-over-year changes in the variables.  

Alternatively, the Board could replace all historical values with their national equivalent when 

projecting losses, thus applying a truly uniform treatment across geographies.  While this 

alternative would have the benefit of maximizing geographic consistency, it would ignore 

meaningful variation in the historical environment and thereby reduce the predictive power of 

the model.  For instance, if a given geography has had higher house price appreciation since its 

origination date compared to the national average, without incorporating these historical values 

into the macroeconomic data used to project losses the model would understate the level of 

equity the borrower has as of the beginning of the projection period.  The Board has therefore 

developed this hybrid approach to estimating losses in the supervisory stress test, in which it 

applies a uniform treatment to projected values of macroeconomic variables across geographies, 

while also retaining historical differences across geographies.  This methodology allows for the 

incorporation of all available historical data needed to produce accurate projections, while 

58 The historical regional unemployment rate and house price index data are seasonally adjusted using the X11 
procedure when a seasonally adjusted version of these series is not available from the source data.  Seasonal 
adjustment is applied for consistency and comparability with the published national scenario variables.  For more 
information about the X11 procedure developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, see Shiskin J., Young A., and 
Musgrave, J., 1967. The X-11 Variant of the Census Method II Seasonal Adjustment Program. U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

avoiding the need to make assumptions about which geographies will have more or less severe 

macroeconomic paths during a hypothetical recession.  Further discussion of how the Board’s 

models account for geographic variation in variables, including a proposed change to the Board’s 

modeling approach, is included in the comprehensive model documentation, available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm. 

Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Board’s treatment of regional 

(i.e., state and county) macroeconomic variables in the credit risk models? 

Question 5: What alternatives should the Board consider to the approach outlined above for 

defining state and county macroeconomic variables based on the national variables 

included in the scenarios?  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of these 

alternatives? 

Auxiliary Variables 

In addition to the 28 variables that the Board discloses each year, the Board also 

generates paths for a limited number of other variables that are used in the supervisory stress test. 

These variables, known as auxiliary variables, are not disclosed by the Board because their paths 

are based on the paths of the 28 disclosed variables (that is, the paths are contingent upon 

movements in the 28 disclosed variables).  For example, the path of Mexico’s gross domestic 

product (GDP) growth rate is a function of the GDP growth rate paths of other country blocs that 

are disclosed.  Some models use these auxiliary variables, as described in the applicable model 

sections of the comprehensive model documentation available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.59   

59 Detailed descriptions of the process for creating the paths of auxiliary variables are included in the applicable 
model documentation.

C.  Data Used in Stress Testing 

Input Data 

The Board generally develops and implements the models with data it collects on 

regulatory reports as well as proprietary third-party industry data.  Most of the data used in the 

supervisory stress test projections are collected through the Capital Assessments and Stress 

Testing regulatory report (FR Y-14), which includes a set of annual (FR Y-14A), quarterly 

(FRY-14Q), and monthly (FRY-14M) schedules.60   

A firm must submit detailed loan and securities information for all material portfolios on 

the FR Y-14Q and FR Y-14M.  The definition of a material portfolio for purposes of FR Y-14 

reporting is based on a firm’s size and complexity.61  Portfolio categories are defined in the FR 

Y-14M and FR Y-14Q reporting instructions.  Each firm has the option to submit the relevant 

data schedule for a given portfolio that does not meet the materiality threshold as defined in the 

instructions.  If a firm does not submit data on its immaterial portfolio(s), the Board will assign 

to that portfolio the median loss rate estimated across the set of firms with material portfolios.  

This loss assumption adheres to the principle of simplicity, as well as the principle of consistency 

and comparability, from the Stress Testing Policy Statement.   

While each firm is responsible for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of data 

provided in the FR Y-14 reports, the Board makes efforts to validate firm-reported data and 

requests resubmissions of data where errors are identified.  If data quality remains deficient after 

resubmission, the Board applies conservative assumptions to a particular portfolio or to specific 

60 The FR Y-14 report forms and instructions are available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx. 

61 Specifically, the definition of a material portfolio varies depending upon a firm’s categorization in the risk-based 
category framework adopted by the Board for determining prudential standards.  See 12 CFR 238.10; 12 CFR 252.5. 

Page 38 of 294 

 
 
data, depending on the severity of deficiencies.  For example, if the Board deems the quality of a 

firm’s submitted data too deficient to produce a stress test model estimate for a particular 

portfolio, then the Board assigns a high loss rate (for example, 90th percentile) or a conservative 

pre-provision net revenue rate (for example, 10th percentile) to the portfolio balances based on 

supervisory stress test projections of portfolio losses or pre-provision net revenue for other 

firms.62  If data that are direct inputs to stress test models are missing or reported erroneously but 

the problem is isolated in such a way that the existing supervisory framework can still be used, 

the Board assigns a conservative value (for example, 10th or 90th percentile) to the specific data 

based on all available data reported by firms.  These assumptions are consistent with the Board’s 

principle of conservatism and policies on the treatment of immaterial portfolios and missing or 

erroneous data, as described in the Stress Testing Policy Statement.  

Additionally, certain stress test model projections rely on data from the Consolidated 

Financial Statements for Holding Companies  regulatory report (FR Y-9C), which contains 

consolidated income statement and balance sheet information for each firm subject to the stress 

test.  The FR Y-9C also includes off-balance sheet items and other supporting schedules, such as 

the components of risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital, that may be used in the stress test 

models.   

In limited circumstances, the Board also uses data provided by third parties in the 

development and execution of the supervisory stress test.  The comprehensive model 

documentation identifies these instances.  The scenario data discussed above is also an input into 

the stress test projections. 

62 Prior to assigning a conservate loss or revenue rate to produce a firm’s stress test results, the Board consults with a 
firm that submits deficient data in order to determine whether the applicable data issue can be remedied. 

Page 39 of 294 

 
 
Data Preparation and Adjustments 

a. 

Data Preparation 

The data inputs the Board uses may not be initially suitable for use in the stress test 

models.  In these cases, the Board takes several steps to prepare the data for use in the stress test 

models.  The specific steps for each model are discussed in the applicable model descriptions 

within the comprehensive model documentation, though generally data are prepared for use in 

the models for two purposes: to remove outliers from the sample and to seasonally adjust the 

data.  These adjustments help ensure that the model results are reasonable.  

The Board may remove outliers or data that are not applicable to the model from the 

sample to facilitate more usable results.  For example, if a commercial real estate loan has a 

unusually high loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (over 150 percent at origination), then data for that loan 

are not included in the Commercial Real Estate Model because its inclusion may produce 

unreliable results.  Additionally, if first lien mortgages are insured by the Federal Housing 

Administration or Department of Veterans Affairs, then they are excluded from the First Lien 

Model because these loans would not generate losses in the supervisory stress test, as they are 

assumed to be fully insured by the U.S. government.  In both examples, the model output is more 

sensible and more reflective of a firm’s risk profile because of these adjustments.   

The Board also may seasonally adjust data, where appropriate.  For example, the vacancy 

rate of hotel commercial real estate exposures may fluctuate on a seasonal cycle, with the 

vacancy rate moving higher or lower in certain months based on a somewhat predictable pattern.  

Because the vacancy rate can be an important variable for calculating losses on hotel commercial 

real estate loans, this rate is seasonally adjusted to ensure that the Commercial Real Estate Model 

produces more stable results.  

Page 40 of 294 

 
These types of data preparation steps help ensure that the Board’s models produce more 

reasonable results and that they align with the principles in the Stress Testing Policy Statement in 

that they generate consistent and robust projections.  The Board therefore expects to continue to 

use these data preparation steps, where appropriate, as they are integral to the supervisory stress 

test process. 

b. 

Data Adjustments 

Data inputs are integral to generating the output of the stress test models, which is a key 

component of a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement.  The Board’s Stress Testing Policy 

Statement notes that the Board does not use data submitted by one or some of the firms unless 

comparable data can be collected from all the firms that have material exposure in a given area 

when generating supervisory stress test projections.63  However, situations may arise where 

adjustments to a firm’s data would make the results more reasonable, and therefore better 

calibrate a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement to its risk profile.  The Board expects to 

continue to make these adjustments going forward, where appropriate.  Examples of when the 

Board may apply these adjustments are described below. 

For example, the Board may apply a data adjustment where there is missing or deficient 

firm-provided data, or where a firm uses divestiture accounting.  As described above, if the 

Board deems the quality of a firm’s submitted data too deficient to produce a stress test model 

estimate for a particular portfolio, then the Board assigns a conservative loss rate (for example, 

90th percentile) or a conservative pre-provision net revenue rate (for example, 10th percentile) to 

the portfolio balances based on supervisory stress test projections of portfolio losses or pre-

provision net revenue for other firms.  If data that are direct inputs to stress test models are 

63 See 12 CFR 252, Appendix B, section 2.8.  

Page 41 of 294 

 
 
missing or reported erroneously but the problem is isolated in such a way that the existing 

supervisory framework can still be used, the Board assigns a conservative value to the specific 

data based on all available data reported by firms.   

Additionally, when a firm sells assets or businesses, it may use divestiture accounting in 

its financial statements until the sale is consummated.  Under divestiture accounting, a firm may 

list divested assets as discontinued operations, classify them as held for sale or available for sale 

instead of held for investment or held to maturity, and report revenues as income from 

discontinued operations.  The accounting classification can be important for the supervisory 

stress test as it may determine which model stresses the assets or income.  For example, in the 

2025 supervisory stress test, the Board adjusted certain input data that had been reclassified due 

to divestiture accounting to improve projections of loan losses and related income to ensure 

consistent treatment across firms with similar risks. 

IV. 

Enhanced Disclosure Process 

The Board is proposing to codify an enhanced disclosure process under which the Board 

would annually publish comprehensive documentation on the stress test models, invite public 

comment on any material changes that the Board seeks to make to those models, and annually 

publish the stress test scenarios for comment.  

A.  Annual Disclosure of Models 

Under the proposal, the Board would annually publish comprehensive documentation on 

the stress test models, similar to the comprehensive documentation the Board is publishing with 

this proposal at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  The 

Board would be required to publish this comprehensive documentation by May 15 of the year in 

which the stress test is performed, and the models described in the documentation would be used 

Page 42 of 294 

 
to produce the stress test results disclosed by the Board by June 30 of that year.  In addition, the 

Board would seek public comment, and respond to such public comment, on any material 

changes to the models before implementing those changes in a stress test.  Material model 

changes are discussed in more detail in Section IV.B of this Supplementary Information.  To 

implement this enhanced disclosure process, the Board is proposing to revise Regulations YY 

and LL, as well as the Stress Testing Policy Statement.   

For example, if the Board did not seek to make any material model changes to its stress 

test models for the 2027 supervisory stress test, then it would publish the comprehensive model 

documentation used in the 2027 stress test cycle by May 15, 2027.  This documentation would 

identify any changes (relative to the models used in the 2026 stress test), including technical, 

non-material changes to the models to improve performance.  This process would allow the 

public to review the changes, as well as comprehensive documentation on the models used in the 

2027 stress test cycle, before the release of the stress test results.   

As an alternative example, if the Board sought to implement a material model change (as 

discussed in Section IV.B of this Supplementary Information) in the 2027 supervisory stress test, 

then the Board would seek comment on the proposed change, consider and respond to public 

feedback, and, then implement, defer, or reject the material model change for the 2027 stress test 

cycle.  If the Board sought to implement the material model change in the 2027 stress test, the 

Board would republish updated model documentation before or simultaneously with the annual 

publication of comprehensive model documentation (i.e., by May 15, 2027).  This process for 

material model changes would increase the transparency of the Board’s stress testing model 

framework and ensure that the public has the opportunity to comment on material model changes 

before they are used in the next stress test cycle.  

Page 43 of 294 

 
Question 6: How else could the Board enhance the transparency and public accountability of 

its stress test models?  For instance, what additional information regarding the stress test 

models, if any, should the Board provide, and why? 

Question 7: How else could the Board facilitate public participation in model development?  

For example, the Board could invite comment on all model changes, rather than only 

material model changes, before implementing them in the stress test.  Under such an 

approach, the Board could make an exception for technical or other types of ministerial 

changes.  Such a process would limit the Board’s flexibility to revise models due to 

unforeseen events and circumstances.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of 

this expanded approach or other approaches to facilitate public participation in model 

development?  How should the Board balance transparency and public accountability 

with model dynamism and operational burden?   

Question 8: What are the advantages and disadvantages of inviting public comment, and 

committing to responding to comments, on material model changes before the Board 

implements them in the subsequent stress test? 

Question 9: What are the advantages and disadvantages of publishing the comprehensive 

model documentation by May 15 of each stress test cycle?  For example, does this 

timeline provide enough time for the public to review any changes made by the Board to 

confirm they are not material?  Should the Board consider publishing the comprehensive 

model documentation earlier at an earlier date, such as April 5, or a later date, such as 

June 30?  What would be the advantages or disadvantages of publishing the 

comprehensive model documentation earlier or later?  

Page 44 of 294 

 
Question 10: The Board is not currently publishing the results of its internal model 

validation process.  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of publishing these 

results or providing more information about its internal model validation process?   

B.  Model Changes 

The proposed rule would define a “model change” to mean “the introduction of a new 

model or a conceptual change to an existing model.”64  Conceptual changes to existing models 

would include changes to model assumptions, incorporation of a new statistical technique to 

estimate loss, or the addition or deletion of any model components or sub-components that 

currently inform a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement.   

Model changes would not include changes resulting from updates or adjustments to input 

data, such as firm data, third-party vendor data, and scenario data, including any re-estimation 

based on this data, as well as changes related to the mechanical implementation of federal, state, 

or local laws that are directly embedded in a stress test model (e.g., the federal statutory tax 

rate).65  As is current practice, the Board would continue to implement model changes related to 

changes in accounting definitions or regulatory capital rules and model parameter re-estimation 

based on newly available data with immediate effect.  These types of adjustments would not be 

considered model changes since they do not substantively change the form of the stress test 

models as described in the documentation.  For example, the Board re-estimates many of its 

models with updated data each year when it runs the supervisory stress test.  This re-estimation 

64 As discussed in Section II.D of this Supplementary Information, there are twenty-one component models that 
comprise the stress test models.  A “new model” would mean a model that fully replaces one of these twenty-one 
component models or is added to the modeling suite (e.g., a 22nd component model).  For purposes of assessing 
materiality, as discussed in Section IV.C of this Supplementary Information, model changes would not be 
aggregated or netted across the component models.   

65  Re-estimation comprises updates to model parameters based on consideration of different input data (e.g., 
incorporating the most recent year’s data as a model input, or incorporating data from new stress test entrants or 
from mergers). 

Page 45 of 294 

 
 
may result in changes to the statistical coefficients produced by some of the models, even though 

the Board has made no conceptual changes to the models.  Under the proposed definition of 

model change, such re-estimation would not be viewed as a model change because the resulting 

changes stem solely from updated data and not from a conceptual change to the models.  In 

contrast, the introduction or revision of a legal requirement that causes a conceptual change to a 

model could be considered a model change, and the Board would seek public comment before 

implementing such a change if it met the proposed definition of a material model change.  

Question 11: What other types of changes to the supervisory stress testing framework could 

the Board consider including in the definition of “model change”?  What are the 

advantages and disadvantages of broadening or narrowing the definition of “model 

change”?  For example, should the Board define “model changes” to include changes 

that result from new or updated input data, or changes that result from using a new, 

third-party data source?   

C.  Material Model Changes 

Each year, the Board refines and enhances its stress test models to reflect advances in 

modeling techniques, respond to model validation findings, incorporate richer and more detailed 

data, or identify more stable models or models with improved performance, particularly under 

stressful economic conditions.  These changes may include re-specification of models based on 

performance testing, benchmarking, and other targeted changes used to produce projections.66  

This process is an important aspect of the modeling framework to help ensure that the stress test 

models capture changes in borrower and lender behavior and bank business practices.  These 

66 Benchmarking is the process of evaluating a model’s performance by comparing its outputs and other 
performance metrics against a specific standard, baseline, or the output and performance of other comparable 
models or relevant data sources. 

Page 46 of 294 

 
 
model changes also help ensure that the models are able to remain dynamic (i.e., can be 

enhanced to capture emerging risks), produce reasonable results, identify salient risks at firms, 

and maintain an optimal level of robustness and stability.   

In addition, the Board must sometimes make changes to its stress test models while it is 

running the stress test in response to unforeseen events or circumstances to ensure that model 

output is reasonable.  For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the vacancy rates for hotel 

properties were unprecedented and the Board made certain adjustments to yield sensible 

commercial real estate loan losses in the model output.  Without making these in-cycle changes, 

the results of the stress test would have been irrational and led to stress capital buffer 

requirements that were not commensurate with applicable firms’ risk profile.   

Under the proposed enhanced disclosure process, if these changes are not material, as 

defined below, the Board would publish these model changes by May 15 of the year in which the 

stress test is performed.  To balance the benefit of public feedback with the operational and 

resource costs of seeking such feedback and to allow the Board to make timely model 

adjustments to ensure reasonable results, the Board would not formally invite public comment on 

these non-material model changes before implementing them in the stress test; however, the 

Board welcomes public feedback on these and all other aspects of the stress test models once 

they are published.  Notably, the Board would not implement any in-cycle adjustments that are 

considered material model changes prior to seeking public comment on the adjustment.  In 

addition, the Board would review and respond to all substantive public comments on material 

model changes before implementing them in the stress test. 

As discussed above, the Board is proposing to publish for comment all material model 

changes and respond to all substantive comments on such material model changes before 

Page 47 of 294 

 
implementing them in the stress test.  For example, if the Board sought to implement a new 

statistical technique that would result in a material model change, then the Board would seek 

public comment prior to implementing either of those changes.67  The Board is proposing to 

define a “material model change” as a model change that could have, in the Board’s estimation, 

an impact on the post-stress common equity tier 1 capital ratio of any firm, or on the average 

post-stress common equity tier 1 capital ratios of all firms required to participate in the upcoming 

stress test cycle, based on the prior year’s severely adverse scenario and prior year’s input data, 

equal to (i) a change of 20 basis points or more in the projected common equity tier 1 ratio of any 

firm participating in the upcoming stress test cycle; or (ii) a change of 10 basis points or more in 

the average of the absolute value of each firm’s change in projected common equity tier 1 ratio.68  

The Board proposes to apply this definition of a material model change across both Regulation 

YY and Regulation LL, such that the individual materiality threshold would apply to all firms 

required to participate in the next stress test under either regulation, and such that the Board’s 

estimation of whether a change meets the aggregate materiality threshold would be determined 

across all firms required to participate in the next stress test under either regulation. 

The Board is proposing to use the threshold of a 20 basis point change in the common 

equity tier 1 capital ratio for individual firms in the definition of material model change because 

that threshold would ensure that the public would be able to comment on any change that would 

67  For purposes of assessing materiality, model changes would not be aggregated or netted across the component 
models.  For example, if the Board proposed a change to both the Pre-Provision Net Revenue Model and Corporate 
Model in the same stress test cycle, the Board would estimate the effects of each change separately for purposes of 
determining materiality.  Similarly, for purposes of assessing materiality, model changes would not be aggregated or 
netted within component models.  For example, if the Board proposed two changes to a component model, the 
Board would evaluate the materiality of each change separately.  
68 The Board would take the absolute value of each firm’s change in projected common equity tier 1 ratio, then 
average those values.  If the average is 10 basis points or greater, the change would constitute a material model 
change. 

Page 48 of 294 

 
 
be likely to affect a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement.  Considering the history of recent 

model changes, a threshold of 20 basis points would generally capture model changes that 

involve conceptual enhancements to model specifications, such as to incorporate improved 

modeling techniques or to capture emerging risks, while scoping out those that are simpler model 

refinements, such as those implemented to ensure that the models maintain consistency given 

changing requirements (e.g., refinements made to accommodate the transition from the London 

Interbank Offered Rate to SOFR).  Therefore, changes of smaller magnitudes would be unlikely 

to impact a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement, particularly if the proposed two-year 

averaging approach to calculate a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement is adopted.69  If the 

two-year averaging approach is not finalized or not finalized as proposed, the Board would 

consider a lower individual materiality threshold of 10 basis points, which would ensure that the 

public would be able to comment on any change that would be likely to affect a firm’s stress 

capital buffer requirement without two-year averaging.   

The Board is proposing the threshold of a 10 basis point average change in the absolute 

value of the change to each firm’s projected common equity tier 1 capital ratio in case a model 

change has minimal individual impacts, but has a notable aggregate impact on firms required to 

participate in the upcoming stress test.  The Board selected 10 basis points for this aggregate 

prong because a model change of this size would be likely to impact the aggregate projected 

common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which is a salient measure of the health of the banking 

system.  A change that satisfies either of these materiality thresholds would be considered a 

material model change.  

69 See 90 FR 16843 (Apr. 22, 2025). 

Page 49 of 294 

 
 
Question 12: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this definition of a material 

model change?  What alternative quantitative thresholds for materiality, if any, should 

the Board consider, and why?  For example, in assessing the materiality of a model 

change, as described in the Stress Testing Policy Statement, the Federal Reserve 

currently considers a change to be highly material if it would result in a change in the 

common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 50 basis points or more for one or more firms, 

relative to the model used in prior years’ supervisory exercises.  What would be the 

advantages and disadvantages of this or other alternative standards? 

Question 13: What alternative definitions of materiality, if any, should the Board consider?  

For example, the Board could consider the impact of a change on a firm’s pre-tax net 

income, rather than its common equity tier 1 ratio.  What are the advantages and 

disadvantages of such alternative definitions? 

Question 14: Under the proposal, for purposes of assessing the materiality of a model 

change, the Board would not aggregate or net the impact across or within component 

models.  What forms of netting or aggregation, if any, would be most appropriate and 

why?  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of netting or aggregating model 

changes across or within component models to assess materiality?  If the Board were to 

net or aggregate model changes, should the Board consider alternative materiality 

thresholds?  For example, the Board could consider an alternative definition of 

materiality that considers the aggregate impact of all of the model changes the Board 

intends to implement in a future stress test cycle.  Alternatively, the Board could 

aggregate the impacts of all model changes to a given suite of models (e.g., credit risk 

Page 50 of 294 

 
models) instead of considering the individual impacts of model changes to the Auto Loan 

Model and the Commercial Real Estate Model.   

Question 15: What are the advantages and disadvantages of inviting and responding to 

public comment on material model changes before implementing those changes?  The 

proposal does not currently specify the length of the comment period.  What are the 

advantages and disadvantages of a set length for the comment period (e.g., 30-day, 60-

day, etc.)?  When considering the appropriate length of the comment period, how should 

the Board evaluate trade-offs, for instance, between ensuring that the public has ample 

time to consider and comment on material model changes and ensuring that the stress 

test results are released by June 30?     

Question 16: If the Board does not adopt its proposal to calculate a firm’s stress capital 

buffer requirement by averaging stress test results over two consecutive years, should the 

Board consider a lower threshold to determine materiality, such as 10 basis points for 

the individual firm threshold instead of the proposed 20 basis points?  What would be the 

advantages and disadvantages of a lower threshold? 

D.  Annual Disclosure of Scenarios 

Under the proposal, the Board would annually publish for comment the proposed stress 

test scenarios by October 15 of the calendar year prior to the stress test, for at least a 30-day 

period.  The timing of the release and duration of the comment period will allow for sufficient 

time to respond to comments and finalize the scenarios within the current window for publishing 

final scenarios by February 15 in each annual stress test cycle.70  The disclosure of the annual 

70 Trading or other components of the scenarios, and any additional scenarios used by the Board, would continue to 
be communicated by March 1 of the calendar year in which the stress test is performed.  12 CFR 238.132(b); 12 
CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.14(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.44(b); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(2)(i). 

Page 51 of 294 

 
 
scenarios for comment, along with the implementation of additional scenario variable guides and 

revisions to the Scenario Design Policy Statement, would meaningfully improve the 

transparency, public accountability, and predictability of the annual stress tests.   

The publication of macroeconomic scenarios in October would use nowcasts, which are 

projections under baseline conditions, to determine the jump-off points for the proposed scenario 

variable paths.  The final scenarios would be updated to include actual data.  The paths of 

scenario variables may be adjusted to some extent between the initial scenario publication and 

the finalized scenario to reflect these updated values.   

By designing and publishing the guides described in Section IX.G of this Supplementary 

Information, the Board expects that the annual severely adverse scenarios will generally be more 

consistent and predictable year-to-year.  As a result, the Board weighed whether publishing the 

annual scenarios for comment in a typical year would contribute meaningful additional 

accountability that would improve the stress test program, and whether the Board should limit 

publication of the annual scenarios for comment to situations where the Board is proposing to 

incorporate a salient risk into the scenarios that is not described in this proposal.  However, in the 

interest of enhancing transparency and public accountability, the Board determined to maintain 

its current practice of publishing its annual scenarios and, further, to propose changes to 

Regulations LL and YY formalizing this disclosure process.  

Additionally, the Board plans to maintain its current practice of disclosing the final 

scenarios only after firms’ portfolios are fixed, as disclosure of the final scenarios prior to the 

jump-off date of the stress test could incentivize firms to modify their businesses to minimize 

losses in the supervisory stress test without changing the actual risk profile of the firms.  

Therefore, the Board is proposing to move the jump-off date of the stress test from December 31 

Page 52 of 294 

 
to September 30.  This proposed change is discussed in greater detail in Section VI.A of this 

Supplementary Information. 

Finally, as described in Section VI.B of this Supplementary Information, the Board is 

proposing to change the as-of date window for the global market shock to occur between 

October 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the year in which the stress test is performed to 

October 1 of the year prior to the year in which the stress test is performed.  Therefore, the Board 

anticipates that the global market shock as-of date will have already occurred for most future 

proposals regarding the initial disclosure of the stress test scenarios.  However, the Board has not 

yet announced the global market shock as-of date for the 2026 stress test and so cannot provide 

the exact relative shock values for certain global market shock variables since the relative shock 

values are a function of the actual data on the as-of date.   

For relative shocks associated with the 2026 global market shock, the data on the global 

market shock as-of date would be applied to determine relative shock values, which will be 

disclosed as part of the finalized scenarios.  For example, if the Board proposes a shock to the 

BBB corporate spread of 200 basis points and the BBB corporate spread market level on the 

global market shock as-of-date is 400 basis points, then the relative shock to the BBB corporate 

spread would be 200/400, or 50 percent, for the 2026 global market shock.  

Question 17: How should the Board publish the annual scenario for comment?  For example, 

the Board could publish the scenario on the Board’s website or include the text and 

supporting materials in a Federal Register notice.  Alternatively, the Board could 

consider codifying each annual scenario as a part of Regulation YY.  What would be the 

advantages and disadvantages of these options or other alternatives? 

Page 53 of 294 

 
Question 18: What are the advantages and disadvantages of publishing the annual scenarios 

for comment prior to the jump-off date of the annual stress test cycle?   

Question 19: What are the advantages and disadvantages of a 30-day comment period?  

Should the Board consider an alternative comment period length?  If so, how long should 

the comment period be (e.g., 45 days, 60 days, etc.)?  When considering the appropriate 

length of the comment period, how should the Board evaluate trade-offs, for instance, 

between ensuring that the public has ample time to consider and comment on annual 

scenarios and ensuring that the stress test scenarios can be finalized before February 

15?     

Question 20: How should the Board analyze comments received from the public on proposed 

scenarios?  What types of information would be helpful to commenters in order to 

understand how the Board incorporates comments received on proposed scenarios before 

finalizing the annual scenarios?   

E.  Stress Capital Buffer Requirement Reconsideration Process  

Under the Board’s capital plan rule, a firm may request reconsideration of the calculation 

of its preliminary stress capital buffer requirement within 15 calendar days of receiving notice of 

the preliminary requirement.71  A request for reconsideration may include a request for an 

informal hearing on the firm’s request for reconsideration; the Board may, in its sole discretion, 

order an informal hearing if the Board finds that a hearing is appropriate or necessary to resolve 

disputes regarding material issues of fact.72  The Board is not proposing to change this 

71  12 CFR 225.8(h)(2)(i); 12 CFR 225.8(i)(2); 12 CFR 238.170(h)(2)(i); 12 CFR 238.170(i)(2).  

72  12 CFR 225.8(i)(3)(ii); 12 CFR 225.8(i)(4); 12 CFR 238.170(i)(3)(ii); 12 CFR 238.170(i)(4).  

Page 54 of 294 

 
 
reconsideration process.73  However, the Board is requesting public input on potential 

enhancements to the stress capital buffer requirement reconsideration process.  In particular, the 

Board seeks public input on the following question:  

Question 21: What enhancements, if any, should the Board consider making to its 

reconsideration request process?  For example, the Board could allow firms more time to 

request reconsideration of their results, broaden or narrow the grounds for and scope of 

review, and/or modify existing reconsideration request requirements in light of the 

publication of the comprehensive model documentation and proposed enhanced 

disclosure process.  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of these 

enhancements? What other changes, if any, should the Board consider making to the 

reconsideration requirements and procedures?  What would be the advantages and 

disadvantages of those changes? 

V. 

Revisions to the Stress Testing Policy Statement   

The Board is also proposing certain changes to the Stress Testing Policy Statement to 

(i) amend the section related to disclosure of information related to the stress test; and (ii) to 

align the Stress Testing Policy Statement with the proposed enhanced disclosure process.   

A.  Future Supervisory Stress Test Results Disclosures  

The Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement states that, in general, the Board does not 

share information regarding supervisory stress test results with firms that is not made available to 

the broader public.  However, providing additional details to a firm about its own results could 

provide the firm with additional visibility into its stressed revenue and loss projections, including 

73  Model adjustments made in response to a reconsideration request granted by the Board would not be considered 
model changes under the proposed enhanced disclosure process.  

Page 55 of 294 

 
 
any underlying risks, and improve the firm’s understanding of its stress capital buffer 

requirement.  For example, additional results information would allow a firm to better 

understand how the stress test translates their balance sheet and income information into 

projected losses and revenue, which could help them better plan their business and understand 

the risk of their exposures.  To provide additional transparency, the Board is therefore proposing 

to revise the Stress Testing Policy Statement to clarify that the Board will generally disclose 

information directly to a firm about the firm’s supervisory stress test results that is not available 

to the broader public, so long as the Board discloses similar information to the other firms 

participating in a given stress test cycle.  For example, the Board may provide a firm’s common 

equity tier 1 capital ratio during all quarters of the projection horizon.  Providing firm-specific 

results directly to the affected firms even when that information is not disclosed to the broader 

public would allow firms to better understand their results while preventing potentially sensitive 

information about a firm from being shared with competitors.  The Board would continue to 

disclose the supervisory stress test results to the public.   

Question 22: What are the advantages and disadvantages of revising the Stress Testing 

Policy Statement to clarify that the Board will generally share non-public information 

about a firm’s results directly with a firm (provided that the Board is disclosing similar 

information to other participating firms)?   

B.  Other Revisions to the Stress Testing Policy Statement  

In addition, the Board is proposing to revise the Stress Testing Policy Statement to align 

it with the proposed enhanced disclosure process.  For example, the Board is proposing to state 

that, during model development, it invites, evaluates, and responds to substantive public input on 

the stress test models.  The Board is also proposing to revise the Stress Testing Policy Statement 

Page 56 of 294 

 
to clarify that its public disclosures about the stress test will now include comprehensive 

descriptions of the models and changes to those models.   

Question 23: What other changes could the Board make to the Stress Testing Policy 

Statement to reflect the enhanced transparency of the supervisory stress test or to 

supplement the Board’s efforts to make the supervisory stress test more transparent and 

to facilitate public participation?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of such 

changes?   

VI.  Other Revisions to the Stress Testing and Capital Plan Rules  

The Board is also proposing to revise the stress testing and capital plan rules to reflect the 

Board’s efforts to disclose more information about the stress test scenarios.   

A.  Stress Test Jump-off Date Change 

The Board is separately seeking comment on the proposed scenarios for use in the 2026 

supervisory stress test.  In general, disclosure of the proposed scenarios prior to the jump-off date 

of the supervisory stress test could incent firms to temporarily modify their businesses to affect 

the results of the stress test without changing the actual risk profile of the firms.  The Board 

recognizes that the increased transparency around scenario design resulting from the disclosure 

of additional guides and a macroeconomic model used in that process would allow firms to 

anticipate the trajectories of key scenario variables.  Using this information, firms could adjust 

their portfolios to specific aspects of the proposed scenarios in ways that would reduce measured 

losses without reducing the actual riskiness of the portfolios.  Such changes to firm business 

profiles could also result in greater than typical quarter-to-quarter variability in the banking 

books of firms.   

Page 57 of 294 

 
To address this potential risk associated with increased transparency, the Board proposes 

to modify the jump-off date of the supervisory and company-run stress tests from December 31 

to September 30, while leaving unchanged the other dates associated with publication of the final 

scenario and stress test results.74  With respect to the capital planning rules, the Board proposes 

accomplishing this change through revision to the definition of “planning horizon” in Regulation 

Y and Regulation LL.  This change would allow the Board to publish the scenario for comment 

after the jump-off date of the stress test, preventing firms from adjusting their exposures based 

on the stress test.  However, this proposed change would introduce an additional quarter of 

staleness to the stress test and stress test results.  This change would also affect firms’ capital 

plan submissions.  Although the due date for firms’ annual capital plan submissions would be 

unchanged, because of the proposed update to the definition of planning horizon, firms’ capital 

plans would not project out as far.   While the Board weighs these risks and considers adjusting 

the stress test jump-off date, the Board seeks input from the public regarding whether these risks 

are outweighed by the value to firms and the public by publishing scenarios prior to the jump-off 

date of the supervisory and company-run stress tests.  Therefore, the Board seeks public 

comment on whether to propose such modifications to limit the ability of firms to adjust their 

balance sheets in response to the proposed scenario prior to the jump-off date of the stress test. 

Question 24: What are the advantages and disadvantages of retaining a jump-off date that 

would occur after the publication of the annual scenario for comment?  Should the Board 

consider retaining the December 31 jump-off date in order to promote transparency?  

Are there additional risks or trade-offs that the Board should consider?  

74 The Board has experience operating the annual supervisory stress test with a September 30 jump-off date.  See, 
e.g., Board, 2015 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Stress Tests Required under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing 
Rules and the Capital Plan Rule (Oct. 23, 2014), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20141023a1.pdf.  

Page 58 of 294 

 
 
Question 25: What would be the advantages and disadvantages of modifying the jump-off 

date of the stress test from December 31 to September 30?  If the Board were to modify 

the jump-off date, what other changes should the Board consider making to the stress test 

timeline?  For example, what would be the advantages and disadvantages if the Board 

were to change the timing of a firm’s capital plan submission?  What would be the 

advantages and disadvantages of these changes? 

Question 26: Should the Board consider modifying the jump-off date of the stress test to a 

later date, rather than an earlier date, in order to accommodate a public comment 

period?  

B.  Global Market Shock Date 

The global market shock (GMS) is applied to market risk positions held by the firms on a 

given as-of date, which, under the Board’s stress test rule, currently occurs between October 1 of 

the previous year and March 1 of the year of a given stress test cycle.75  Under the Board’s 

regulations, the GMS can apply to both the supervisory stress test and the company-run stress 

test for applicable firms.  For the supervisory stress test and the company-run stress test, the 

Board must generally provide each affected firm with a description of the GMS and with the 

specific GMS as-of date by March 1 of the year in which the stress test occurs.76  For the 

company-run stress test, the Board generally must also notify each affected firm by December 31 

of year preceding the stress test that the firm is required to include additional components or 

scenarios in its company-run stress test.77  

75 See, e.g., 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.14(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(2)(i). 
76 See, e.g., 12 CFR 238.132(b); 12 CFR 238.143(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.14(b)(2)(i); 12 CFR 252.44(b); 12 CFR 
252.54(b)(2)(i). 

77 See, e.g., 12 CFR 238.143(b)(4)(i); 12 CFR 252.14(b)(4)(i); 12 CFR 252.54(b)(4)(i). 

Page 59 of 294 

 
 
The Board selects a cycle-specific as-of date each year and, typically, announces it to 

firms about two weeks later to ensure the firms retain necessary data.  The as-of date is expected 

to change from year to year to avoid creating potential incentives for firms to take temporary 

trading positions.  However, there is a comprehensive date selection process that, in practice, 

shortens the actual window during which the GMS as-of date is generally selected.  A wider date 

range would allow the Board to capture a broader range of market risks across different time 

periods, thereby improving the risk capture of the global market shock.  The Board therefore 

proposes revising the date range for the GMS as-of date to occur between (inclusive of) 

October 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the year in which the stress test is performed to 

(exclusive of) October 1 of the calendar year one year prior to the year in which the stress test is 

performed.  By way of example, this change would mean that for the 2026 supervisory stress 

test, the GMS as-of date could fall on any date between October 1, 2024, through September 30, 

2025.  The Board proposes using this date range because it would allow the Board to choose 

from a full year’s worth of potential GMS as-of dates.  Additionally, the proposed range would 

include only dates prior to the release of the given stress test cycle’s GMS for notice and 

comment.  Therefore, firms subject to the GMS would not be able to use their knowledge of the 

GMS as-of date to update their balance sheet positions or adjust their portfolios to minimize 

stress losses without a commensurate reduction in risk profile.   

In conjunction with the proposal to change the GMS as-of date window, the Board also 

proposes to change the date by which the Board needs to notify affected firms of this as-of date 

from March 1 of the year in which the stress test occurs.  Unless it determines otherwise, the 

Board must notify affected firms of the GMS as-of date by October 15 of the year prior to the 

year in which the stress test is performed.  The Board would continue to provide firms with a 

Page 60 of 294 

 
description of the GMS, as finalized, by March 1 of the calendar year in which the stress test 

occurs.  Additionally, to conform to the proposed changes to the stress test timeline, the Board 

proposes to change the date by which the Board must notify firms that they are required to 

include additional components or scenarios in their company-run stress test from December 31 to 

September 30 of the year preceding the stress test.  This change would ensure that firms are 

aware of the components to which they would be subject prior to the annual publication of the 

scenarios for notice and comment. 

Question 27: What are the advantages and disadvantages of modifying the window for the 

GMS as-of date in the stress test from October 1 of the calendar year one year prior to 

the year in which the stress test is performed through March 1 of the year in which the 

stress test is performed, to a date that is no earlier than October 1 of calendar year two 

years prior to the year in which the stress test is performed and that precedes October 1 

of the calendar year one year prior to the year in which the stress test is performed?  

What alternative GMS as-of date ranges, if any, should the Board consider, and why?  In 

addition to changing the GMS as-of date window, what other changes, if any, should the 

Board consider making to the stress test timeline?  What effects, if any, would changing 

the window for the GMS as-of date have on any other aspects of the stress test or the 

stress test timeline?  

Question 28: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed dates by which the 

Board would notify firms of the GMS as-of date, provide a description of any associated 

components, and notify firms of any additional components that they are required to 

include in their supervisory and company-run stress tests?  What alternative dates, if any, 

should the Board consider for these activities and why?  For example, to better ensure 

Page 61 of 294 

 
that more stakeholders provide input into the proposed GMS, the Board could wait until 

the scenarios are final before notifying firms which components they must include in their 

company-run run stress tests.   

Question 29: The GMS only considers a firm’s positions on one as-of date and only under 

one set of shocks.  Should the Board consider alternative approaches to further increase 

the risk capture of the GMS, such as applying the GMS to more than one as-of date or 

more than one set of shocks for a given stress test?  What would be the advantages and 

disadvantages of these alternative approaches?  What other approaches should the 

Board consider to improve the risk capture of the GMS and why? 

C.  Amendment to the Dividend Add-on Component Calculation 

The dividend add-on component of the stress capital buffer requirement currently 

comprises planned dividends in the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning (or 

projection) horizon of the supervisory stress test.78  Under the current framework, the planned 

dividends that are incorporated in the stress capital buffer requirement align with the effective 

date of the stress capital buffer requirement (that is, October 1 generally is the first day of the 

fourth quarter of the existing planning horizon) and last for the one-year period through which 

the stress capital buffer requirement is expected to be effective (that is, through the seventh 

quarter of the existing planning horizon, after which the following year’s stress capital buffer 

requirement would be expected to take effect).   

As part of this rulemaking, the Board is proposing to change the jump-off date of the 

stress test from December 31 to September 30.  To maintain alignment between the dividend 

78 See 12 CFR 225.8(d)(16); 12 CFR 238.130.  The planning (or projection) horizon for the supervisory stress test is 
nine consecutive quarters starting on the jump-off date of the supervisory stress test. 

Page 62 of 294 

 
 
add-on component of the stress capital buffer requirement and the one-year period during which 

the requirement typically is effective, the Board proposes to change the dividend add-on 

component to cover dividends issued in quarters five through eight, instead of quarters four 

through seven, of the planning horizon of the supervisory stress test.  This change involves 

updates to the capital plan rules, at Regulation Y and Regulation LL, to any references to the 

relevant quarters of the planning horizon.79  This proposed revision is intended to maintain the 

alignment between the dividend add-on component and the one-year period during which the 

stress capital buffer requirement generally is effective, assuming the proposal to move the jump-

off date of the stress test to September 30 is adopted.  If this aspect of the proposal is not 

adopted, then the Board would not adjust the planning horizon period for planned dividends.   

Such a change to the planning horizon period has likewise been proposed as part of the 

Board’s proposed Modifications to the Capital Plan Rule and Stress Capital Buffer Requirement, 

issued in April 2025, in order to similarly maintain alignment between that proposal’s updates to 

the effective date of a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement and the dividend add-on 

component.80  Should both proposals be finalized as proposed, the Board would expect to adjust 

the dividend add-on component of the stress capital buffer requirement to maintain alignment 

between the dividend add-on component and the one-year period in which the stress capital 

buffer requirement generally is effective.  In such an instance, the Board would expect to change 

the dividend add-on component to cover dividends issued in quarters six through nine of the 

planning horizon of the supervisory stress test.

the dividend add-on component of the stress capital buffer requirement? 

VII.  Revisions to the FR Y-14A/Q/M 

To reduce regulatory reporting burden, support the proposed model changes, and improve 

risk capture, the Board is proposing several revisions to the FR Y-14A/Q/M.  To reduce 

regulatory reporting burden, the Board is proposing to remove items and documentation 

requirements that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test.  For example, the 

proposal would remove certain FR Y-14 supporting documentation requirements that are no 

longer needed to assess a firm’s FR Y-14 submission.  The Board also proposes to collect 

additional data that would support the supervisory stress test models and improve risk capture.  

For example, to capture data in a manner that aligns better with the treatment of private equity 

under the macroeconomic scenario, the proposal would include revisions for reporting private 

equity exposures and associated hedges.  Additionally, to broaden the consideration of hedges 

and revenue and loss sharing agreements in the stress test, the Board is proposing revisions that 

would capture more data on various types of hedges or revenue and loss sharing agreements.  

Lastly, the Board is proposing several minor revisions to clarify the FR Y-14 instructions or 

align with the proposed changes to the stress test timeline.  The proposed revisions are described 

in Section XI.A of this Supplementary Information. 

VIII.  Proposed Changes to the Stress Test Modeling Framework 

The Board is proposing to use the models described in the documents posted on the 

Board’s website to generate results for the 2026 supervisory stress test.  Included in these 

descriptions are some model specifications that were not used to conduct the 2025 supervisory 

stress test but are proposed to be used for the 2026 supervisory stress test.  These proposed 

Page 64 of 294 

 
model changes are summarized in Section VIII.A.81  In addition, a detailed description of and 

rationale for each of these proposed model changes is provided in a separate document posted on 

the Board’s website with the comprehensive model documentation.  Section VIII.B of this 

Supplementary Information provides an analysis of the potential effects of the proposed changes.  

Based on this analysis, implementing the proposed model changes and proposed revisions to the 

global market shock scenario design in the 2024 and 2025 stress tests would have, independent 

of other factors, increased the aggregate projected common equity tier 1 (CET1) stress ratio, on 

average, by 29 basis points.  This is equivalent to a reduction in stress capital buffer requirements 

of approximately 23 basis points or approximately 2.2 percent of current required capital.  

A.  Proposed Changes to Stress Test Models 

The Board is proposing several changes to the supervisory stress test models for the 2026 

stress test, which are discussed in more detail in the Model Changes document provided on the 

Board’s website, at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  

More significant proposed changes to the Pre-provision Net Revenue and Operational Risk 

Models are described within the comprehensive model documentation, also available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  The Board is 

requesting comment on the proposed changes, together with the model documentation.  

With respect to the credit risk models, the Board is proposing to change how it uses 

geography in scenario variables (First Lien, Home Equity, Credit Cards, Auto, and Commercial 

Real Estate Models); change how it treats foreclosures under judicial supervision (First Lien and 

Home Equity Models); change how it calculates loss given default for international loans 

81 These proposed changes would constitute “model changes” under the proposed definition of “model change,” as 
discussed in Section IV.B of this Supplementary Information. 

Page 65 of 294 

 
 
(Commercial Real Estate and Corporate Models); change how it includes losses attributable to 

accrued interest and carrying costs (First Lien and Home Equity Models); change how it uses 

multipliers in the Provisions Model; revise the mortgage loss given default model in the First 

Lien Model; revise the bank card model in the Credit Card Model; change how it projects losses 

on auto leases in the Auto Model; and update the probability of default, loss given default, and 

exposure at default components in the Corporate Model. 

With respect to the market risk models, the Board is proposing to update several of its 

market risk models for the 2026 stress test, including to simplify the Yield Curve Model; adjust 

its process for projecting credit valuation adjustments for derivative positions in the Credit 

Valuation Adjustment Model; lower the loss given default assumption amount and loan 

equivalent factor parameter in the Fair Value Option Model; update and simplify the Securities 

Model; and exclude additional counterparties in the Largest Counterparty Default Model.  

With respect to the net revenue models, the Board is proposing an alternative suite of pre-

provision net revenue component models that depart from the current panel regression-based 

approach.  This alternative suite is described in the Pre-provision Net Revenue Model 

documentation, available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-

2026.htm.  The Board is also proposing to discontinue the current regression model used to 

project operational risk losses and instead project losses with a distributional model.  This 

alternative model is described in the Operational Risk Model documentation, also available at 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  

Aggregate impacts on regulatory capital of the model changes described above are small 

(see Table 2).  Across risk stripes, the proposed model changes would reduce credit, market, and 

operational losses, which would be balanced by the effects of the proposed model changes to the 

Page 66 of 294 

 
Pre-provision Net Revenue Model.  Across firm categories, GSIBs would observe modest 

increases in aggregate projected CET1 stress ratio under the proposed changes.  Firms subject to 

Category II-III standards would also observe a modest increase in their projected CET1 stress 

ratio. 

Question 31: The Board invites public comment on these proposed model changes.  What 

other changes, if any, should the Board consider implementing in the 2026 stress test 

cycle, either instead of or in addition to the proposed changes?   

Question 32: What other information or data should the Board consider to assess the 

quantitative economic impact of the proposed model changes and why?   

B.  Analysis of Proposed Model Changes 

To further enhance the transparency of the stress test models, this section analyzes the 

potential effects of the proposed model changes described in Section VIII.A of this 

Supplementary Information, and the liquidity horizon revisions to the global market shock 

scenario design described in Section IX.H of this Supplementary Information, that inform the 

Board’s determination of firms’ stress capital buffer requirements.   

In aggregate, the stress test model and scenario changes are not expected to materially 

change capital requirements for firms subject to the supervisory stress test, across various stress 

scenarios and jump-off conditions at the start of the test.  To illustrate the effect of these 

proposed model changes, this analysis averaged the impact of these changes on the CET1 stress 

ratio for a balanced sample of 30 firms subject to the 2024 stress test and expected to participate 

in the 2026 stress test, then aggregated the averages.82  The analysis estimates that the proposed 

82 This analysis used the 2024 and 2025 scenarios, respectively, and the same data used for those years’ stress tests. 
The estimated impact of these changes remains highly sensitive to the stress test scenario and firm-specific data for 

Page 67 of 294 

 
 
model and scenario changes, independent of other models and components, could have resulted 

in an increase of 29 basis points in the average aggregate CET1 stress ratio.  This is equivalent to 

a reduction in stress capital buffer requirements of approximately 23 basis points or 

approximately 2.2 percent of current required capital.  The analysis estimates that the model 

changes would reduce stress capital buffer requirements by approximately 13 basis points, and 

that the revisions to the global market shock scenario design, described in Section IX.H of this 

Supplementary Information, would reduce stress capital buffer requirements by approximately 

10 basis points.  For U.S. GSIBs, the analysis estimates a decline of 25 basis points of stress 

capital buffer requirements.   

As the U.S. banking system’s 13.0 percent CET1 capital ratio (8.2 percent leverage ratio) 

is well within the estimated optimal range in the literature,83 the net benefit of modest changes to 

the overall level of banking system capital is small.84  However, as discussed further below, the 

each year.  While the precise impact will vary each year based on stress test scenarios and specific firm data, Board 
analysis across a range of conditions shows that capital requirements should remain essentially unchanged.

companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets and depository institutions without parent holding 
companies.  The aggregate CET1 ratio additionally excludes holding companies that have opted in to the 
Community Bank Leverage Ratio requirement, and reflects standardized risk-weighted assets. 

Page 68 of 294 

 
 
proposed model changes have varied effects on capital requirements across loss type and firm 

category.   

Based on this analysis, the proposed model changes are expected to result in more risk-

sensitive capital requirements, independent of their effect on the level of requirements.  

Specifically, implementation of the proposed model changes would render the models more 

stable, likely reducing misalignment between firms’ losses under stress and their respective stress 

capital buffer requirements.  To the extent that the stress capital buffer requirements are affected 

by these proposed model changes and are a part of firms’ most-binding capital constraint,85 the 

proposed model changes would thereby improve the risk sensitivity—and efficiency and 

effectiveness—of capital requirements.   

This analysis recognizes that the limited overall effect on stressed CET1 capital ratios 

masks significant variation across the different loss drivers.  As shown in Table 2 below, the 

proposed model changes could result in less severe credit, market, and operational loss 

estimates—which would be driven by overhauling the wholesale corporate probability of default 

model and discontinuing the macroeconomic regression approach for operational risk loss 

estimation, as described further in the Corporate Model and Operational Risk Model 

descriptions.  However, the proposed changes to the Pre-provision Net Revenue Model would 

offset these loss reductions.  By reducing the reliance of net revenue projections on recent 

outcomes and relying more on firm projections of net noninterest income, the projections of net 

revenue would be more consistent with a stress scenario and would better align with firms’ 

projections. 

85 The capital requirements of firms with stress losses plus dividend add-ons reliably below the 2.5 percent capital 
conservation buffer would be unaffected by the proposed model changes.

Proposed Changes to the Scenario Design Policy Statement  

The Board is also proposing to make several changes to the Scenario Design Policy 

Statement.  While many of these proposed changes are technical in nature, this section identifies 

substantive changes and requests comment on those proposed changes.   

Question 33: The Board invites comment on all aspects of the technical and substantive 

proposed revisions to the Scenario Design Policy Statement.  What are the advantages 

and disadvantages of these proposed changes?  What would be the advantages and 

disadvantages if the Board were to consider describing the Board’s expectations for 

additional components of the scenario design framework? 

Page 70 of 294 

 
 
A.  Changes to the Background and Overview and Scope Sections 

The Board is proposing to make limited changes to the first two sections of the Scenario 

Design Policy Statement, which address background and overview and scope topics, 

respectively.  In the background section, the Board would clarify that the stress tests primarily 

focus on credit risk, operational risk, and market risk.  The inclusion of operational risk in this 

list helps clarify the Board’s continued focus on designing a supervisory tool that makes a 

valuable forward-looking assessment of large financial companies’ capital adequacy under 

hypothetical economic and financial market conditions.  The Board would also clarify that it 

expects to provide only two different sets of macroeconomic scenarios for both the supervisory 

and company-run stress tests.  These two sets of macroeconomic scenarios are the baseline and 

severely adverse scenario.  This change would clarify the quantity of macroeconomic scenarios 

the Board expects to provide, consistent with the removal of a separate adverse scenario.86  

In the overview and scope section, the Board would make conforming edits to the 

description of the organization of the Scenario Design Policy Statement to reflect the changes 

discussed earlier in this proposal.   

Question 34: What additional changes, if any, should the Board consider making to these 

sections, and why?  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of providing more 

than two scenarios?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Board’s 

continued focus on credit, operational, and market risk? 

B.  Changes to the Content of the Stress Test Scenarios Section 

The Board is proposing to make two general changes to this section, which describes the 

Board’s expectations for the content of the published stress test scenarios.  

86 84 FR 59032, 59061 (Nov. 1, 2019).  

Page 71 of 294 

 
 
First, as described below, this section would be amended to clarify that the Board expects 

to generally publish two different macroeconomic scenarios: the baseline and severely adverse 

scenarios.  This section would also be revised to clarify that the Board expects to invite comment 

on severely adverse scenarios.  

Second, as described in Section IX.H of this Supplementary Information, the Board is 

proposing to make certain changes related to the global market shock component.  See Section 

IX.H of this Supplementary Information for a discussion of those changes.  

Question 35: What additional changes, if any, should the Board consider making to these 

sections, and why?   

C.  Approach for Formulating Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Baseline Scenario 

The Board is proposing to provide additional details describing the process by which the 

Board would set the paths of the variables in the baseline and severely adverse scenarios.  In 

particular, the amendments reflect that the Board would post on the Board’s website a description 

of the macroeconomic model utilized to support the construction of the baseline and severely 

adverse scenarios in the annual stress test.  By posting a description of this model (the 

“macroeconomic model for stress testing”) on the Board’s website, the Board expects to improve 

the transparency, public accountability, and predictability around the Board’s scenario design 

framework, particularly with respect to the baseline scenario and certain variables in the severely 

adverse scenario.  The Board recognizes that, while these enhancements are consistent with the 

Board’s goal of increased transparency in the supervisory stress test, they may constrain the 

design of the scenario paths for some variables to follow those prescribed by the macroeconomic 

model for stress testing.  Nevertheless, the Board expects that other aspects of the proposed 

changes to the Scenario Design Policy Statement will preserve sufficient flexibility to allow the 

Page 72 of 294 

 
Board to adjust the severity of the annual scenario based on relevant indicators of economic and 

financial conditions and other emergent procyclical factors.  Importantly, the Board uses these 

models to generate paths for the scenario variables only.  These models are used solely for stress 

testing purposes and the output is not a forecast of the Board.   

Question 36: What are the advantages and disadvantages of adopting a macroeconomic 

model for stress testing to guide the selection of certain variables in the baseline and 

severely adverse scenarios?  

Question 37: What additional changes, if any, should the Board consider making to this 

section, and why?    

D.  Scenario Narrative: Refinement to the Recession Approach 

A number of considerations contribute to the Board’s formulation of the severely adverse 

scenario.  As a starting point, the basic approach adopted by the Board is the recession 

approach—the notion that the Board will construct a scenario informed by the historical paths of 

macroeconomic and financial market variables across post-war U.S. recessions.  However, 

different recessions have differed in important respects, and a simple recreation of a given 

episode or an average over all recessions would fail to reproduce important potential stressors to 

firms’ balance sheets.  Hence, in applying the recession approach, the Board develops a specific 

narrative characterizing the hypothetical recession represented by the scenario to help inform the 

specific paths for scenario variables.  This narrative combined with data are then modified to 

account for the Board’s stress testing principle of conservatism alongside other considerations 

offered by the literature on stress testing including a goal to develop sufficient severity and 

credibility of the scenarios, and a goal to not add sources of procyclicality to the financial

system, as described below.87  This section gives an overview of these considerations and other 

details, providing a common structure for the discussion outlined in the guides for individual 

variables under this framework, in Section IX.G of this Supplementary Information.  

The Recession Approach 

The Board intends to continue to use a recession approach to develop the severely 

adverse scenario.  Under the recession approach, the Board expects to specify the future paths of 

variables to reflect conditions that characterize post-war U.S. recessions, generating either a 

typical or specific recreation of a post-war U.S. recession.  The Board chose this approach in 

developing past scenarios, and in the Scenario Design Policy Statement, because it has observed 

that the conditions that typically occur in recessions—such as increasing unemployment, 

declining asset prices, and contracting loan demand—can put significant stress on firms’ balance 

sheets.  This stress can occur through a variety of channels, including higher loss provisions due 

to increased delinquencies and defaults, losses on trading positions through sharp moves in 

market prices, and lower bank income through reduced loan originations.  For these reasons, the 

Board expects that the paths of economic and financial variables in the severely adverse scenario 

should, at a minimum, resemble the paths of those variables observed during a recession.  The 

guide for each variable in this framework reviews the movements of that variable across past 

recessions and bases the formulation of its scenario path on that analysis.  While the recession 

approach provides a starting point for the formulation of the scenario, recessions are not all the 

same. The length and depth of recessions differ, as do the parts of the economy and financial 

87 12 CFR 252, Appendix B. 

Page 74 of 294 

 
 
markets that are most affected, so the Board must include other considerations in its scenario 

design.  

The Scenario Narrative 

Because recessions have differed in cause, character, and consequence—from oil price 

shocks and housing slumps to asset-price busts and pandemics, from short to long, and from mild 

to moderate to severe—the Board augments the basic recession approach with an annual scenario 

narrative.  The annual scenario narrative provides qualitative direction on how the Board builds 

that year’s severely adverse scenario.   

While some specifics of the narrative may be adjusted on a year-to-year basis to reflect 

developments in the macroeconomic and financial environment, the overall narrative motivating 

scenario design will be that of a sharp recession triggered by an adverse shock to financial 

markets.  Under the proposal, the Board expects that the macroeconomic scenario used in the 

Board’s annual supervisory severely adverse scenario will begin with a sudden and significant 

increase in uncertainty and associated rapid deterioration in risk appetite that cause a spike in 

financial market volatility and a sharp decline in many U.S. and foreign financial assets.  The 

resulting turmoil would disrupt funding markets and lead to widespread deleveraging, including 

forced sales of illiquid assets at fire sale prices by a range of financial firms and some temporary 

breakdowns in the typical correlations between financial asset prices.  (Such sharp changes in 

financial conditions have been observed previously in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 or 

regional wars, the failure or distress of a large financial institution, or sudden shifts in the 

economic policies in advanced economies.)   

Under the Board’s recession approach, the Board expects that, although financial market 

functioning returns to normal within a few months of the initial shock, uncertainty remains high 

Page 75 of 294 

 
and risk appetite remains low for an extended period.  The sustained flight to quality would be 

expected to push down risk-free interest rates but keep credit conditions tight and financial asset 

prices depressed for several quarters.  The market dysfunction would cause a contraction in the 

supply of credit from other types of financial intermediaries that would create demands on banks 

to provide substantial liquidity to existing customers with formal credit lines.  Banks would also 

make ad hoc decisions to support customers without formal arrangements when doing so could 

lead to lower losses on their existing loans.88  This shift in demand for credit toward banks from 

other financial intermediaries would lead to banks’ balance sheets remaining constant even as 

overall credit demand declines.89  This feature of the scenario is supported by the stress testing 

principle of conservatism.90  To that end, maintaining higher capital requirements during periods 

of economic expansion ensures that stress tested firms employ sufficient capital to absorb losses 

and support the economy during a downturn.  

In the scenario, the news from financial markets would cause near-immediate decisions 

by consumers to curtail spending and by businesses to cut payroll and cancel planned 

investments, leading to a demand-driven contraction in economic activity putting downward 

pressure on inflation.  The initial disruption to spending and employment along with tightening 

credit conditions would trigger a negative feedback loop that results in further declines in 

88 For example, in June 2020 the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued interagency guidance to 
bank examiners stating, “examiners will not subject a … modified loan to adverse classification solely because the 
value of the underlying collateral has declined …, provided that the borrower has ability to repay...” See Interagency 
COVID-19 Examiner Guidance,

payrolls, investment, and spending in subsequent quarters.  With businesses shrinking or failing 

in the scenario, demand for commercial real estate would decrease significantly relative to 

supply, leading to large declines in commercial property prices.  Meanwhile, rising household 

financial distress would lead to increased supply of homes for sale and reduced household 

formation, which would depress residential real estate markets.  

The financial market dysfunction and deepening recession in the United States would 

spill over to its major trading partners, including the euro area, United Kingdom, Japan, and 

Developing Asia.  Those areas would experience declines in economic activity commensurate 

with the global slowdown running from 2008 to 2010.  Consistent with existing stress testing 

principles, this scenario assumes that permanent government stabilization programs (e.g., 

unemployment insurance) and monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere would 

function normally, but that there would be no extraordinary measures taken by fiscal or financial 

authorities to support the economy or financial markets during this time.  The specific 

implications of this narrative for scenario variables are detailed in each guide, but the narrative 

interacts importantly with the recession approach: financial recessions often exhibit different 

properties than other recessions, as they are often steeper, deeper, and more drawn-out than 

typical, non-financial recessions.91  Adopting this scenario narrative reflects a principle of 

conservatism, and is in line with recommendations from the stress testing literature, as discussed 

in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  

Question 38: The Board invites comment on all aspects of how the Board designs the 

scenario narrative in the annual stress test.  What are the advantages and disadvantages 

of adopting this financial recession approach?  What other approaches, if any, should the

Board consider adopting, and why?  What adjustments, if any, to the financial recession 

approach should the Board consider adopting, and why? 

Adding Salient Risks to the Severely Adverse Scenario 

Consistent with the Scenario Design Policy Statement, under this proposal, the Board 

expects that the severely adverse scenario would be developed to reflect the current level of 

vulnerabilities or risks to the banking sector that are apparent in relevant indicators of economic 

and financial conditions.  The Board anticipates that the proposed guides for certain scenario 

variables described below provide an appropriate range of values to design the severely adverse 

scenario in most years.  The waxing and waning of relevant indicators of economic and financial 

conditions will inform the Board’s decisions about where to set the value of those parameters 

within those ranges for each variable.   

The Board continues to expect that there will be some important instances when it will be 

appropriate to augment the recession approach with salient risks and to set variables values 

inside of, and in some cases, outside of the ranges and values provided in the guides in the 

Scenario Design Policy Statement.  As a result, each year, the Board will consider particular 

risks to the financial system and to the domestic and international macroeconomic outlook 

identified by its economists, bank supervisors, and financial market experts.  The Board, using its 

internal analysis and supervisory information and in consultation with the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will then determine 

whether any of those risks appear significantly more elevated than usual or, conversely, whether 

risks are unusually low at a particular time, such that they cannot be appropriately reflected by 

choosing values within the ranges of the proposed guides.  In those cases, which it expects to be 

infrequent, the Board will make appropriate adjustments to the paths of specific economic 

Page 78 of 294 

 
variables.  These adjustments will not always be reflected in the general severity of the recession 

and, thus, all macroeconomic variables; rather, the adjustments will sometimes apply to a subset 

of variables to reflect co-movements in these variables that are historically less typical.   

To assist the public in assessing the use of salient risks in the scenario, the Board 

considered the following examples.  A stress test initiated in a period of unusually high 

uncertainty and rapid deterioration in economic and financial conditions, such as the first quarter 

of 2009 or the first quarter of 2020, likely would prove challenging for the ranges in this 

proposed framework.  In each case, the prevailing conditions made it plausible that key variables 

would settle beyond the range of their previous peak or trough values, on which the guides for 

the variables in the severely adverse scenario are calibrated.  Although the unemployment guide 

remained flexible enough to respond to the spike in the unemployment rate to nearly 15 percent 

during the first months of the COVID-19-related business closures in 2020, the paths of other 

variables may have needed to be adjusted more severely if the economy had not recovered as 

quickly as it did. 

As another example, the Board may become increasingly concerned about vulnerabilities 

related to a particular asset class that was experiencing rapid and persistent price increases 

supported by increasingly leveraged investors. Those circumstances existed in the housing 

market in the early 2000s and may have tested the credibility of a guide framework based solely 

on past performance of home prices, given that up until then, the price index for homes the 

Board uses for stress testing had rarely experienced a decline.92   

92 The Board uses the Price Index for Owner-Occupied Real Estate, Z.1 Release (Financial Accounts of the United 
States), Federal Reserve Board (series FL075035243.Q). 

Page 79 of 294 

 
 
Sometimes, the salient risk may arise within an asset class. The Board most recently 

incorporated this type of salient risk in the 2024 stress test scenario.  That year, the Board noted 

unusually high vulnerabilities in types of commercial properties that could be most at risk for a 

sustained drop in income and asset values due to the prevalence of remote work.93   

The Board is proposing two changes to its consideration of salient risks in the severely 

adverse scenario.  First, the Board would remove paragraph 4.2.4(d) from the Scenario Design 

Policy Statement.  Removing this paragraph could help improve the transparency of the scenario 

design process by limiting the Board’s expectations for considering risks of uncertain 

significance.  While this approach would reduce the Board’s ability to test for emerging and 

untested risks in the financial system through the severely adverse scenario, the Board expects 

that the remaining components of the Board’s supervisory stress test should be sufficient to 

establish a credible severely adverse scenario.   

Second, where the Board does consider salient risks in designing the severely adverse 

scenario, the Board will endeavor to disclose and explain the Board’s reasoning in the Board’s 

publication of the annual stress test scenarios, and subsequently adjust those aspects of the 

scenario, if necessary, in response to those comments.   

Question 39: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Board’s approach to 

considering salient risks?  What additional or alternative approaches, if any, should the 

Board consider for the consideration of salient risks?  What additional or alternative 

circumstances should the Board take into account when evaluating whether to consider 

salient risks, if any?

E.  Changes to Construction of Certain Variables in the Severely Adverse Scenario   

As noted above, the Board finalized changes to the Scenario Design Policy Statement in 

2019 that established a guide that it would use in setting the size of the maximum change in the 

unemployment rate and the timing of its peak.  The Scenario Design Policy Statement also 

introduced a guide to govern the size of the maximum decline in house prices in the severely 

adverse scenario.  This proposal maintains those features of the guides for those two variables, 

introduces guides that will be used to set the changes in the values, and the timing of those 

changes, for more variables in the severely adverse scenario, and provides additional context for 

the path of each variable before it reaches the maximum change.  In addition, the Board is 

separately disclosing a specific macroeconomic model that it proposes to use to translate the 

paths of certain variables that are set using the proposed guides into internally consistent 

projections for the remaining variables, such as the 3-month Treasury bill rate, GDP, Disposable 

Personal Income (DPI), and inflation.   

In addition to updating existing guides for the unemployment rate and house prices, the 

Board is proposing to establish a guide for each of the following variables: equity prices; the 

VIX index; 5-year Treasury yields; 10-year Treasury yields; BBB corporate bond yields; 

mortgage rates; commercial real estate prices; and certain international scenario values.  These 

include all but one of the remaining financial market variables typically included in the domestic 

severely adverse scenario disclosure each year (the exception being the 3-month Treasury bill 

rate, as discussed below). 

The Board uses guides to inform its determination of the behavior of these financial 

market variables in the severely adverse scenario, rather than model predictions, for several 

reasons.  Although the parameters of the guides are calibrated based on an analysis of historical 

Page 81 of 294 

 
changes in those variables during recessions and the resulting set of scenario paths typically 

would be consistent with historical co-movements in those variables, using explicit forward-

looking models of these variables to determine scenario paths would be inconsistent with several 

stress testing principles, such as simplicity and transparency, as described below.  

Under a model-driven approach to determine the paths of these variables, each model 

would require the Board to identify, design, test, explain, and publish additional assumptions, 

variables, formulas, and parameters that would drive the results of the model.  Models of 

financial market variables can be particularly unreliable during periods of severe stress like the 

environment envisioned by the hypothetical severely adverse scenario.94  Thus, the model-driven 

approach to determining these variables would contrast with the stress testing principle of using 

simpler and more transparent approaches, where appropriate.   

The Board believes that the guide-based approach also better achieves the stress testing 

principle of using a stable process that is reliably able to capture the impact of economic stress.  

These simple, transparent guides also will allow the Board to use its judgment at times when it is 

necessary to account for conditions that are plausible even if they have not been observed 

previously, consistent with the stress testing principle of conservatism.  Finally, the guides better 

preserve the Board’s ability to adjust the severity of the stress test to avoid adding to procyclical 

forces, when doing so is appropriate and consistent with fostering financial stability.  The 

Board’s judgment about the appropriateness of the annual stress test scenarios will reflect 

changes in the specific risks or vulnerabilities that the Board, in consultation with the other 

federal banking agencies, determines should be considered in the annual stress tests.95

The paths for the remaining variables in the domestic scenario—GDP, DPI, inflation, and 

the 3-month Treasury rate—will be informed by the Board’s macroeconomic model for stress 

testing.96  In contrast to the guide-based approach described above for certain variables, the 

Board uses a model-driven approach for these remaining variables because they are particularly 

suited to model projections that are simple to produce and explain.  As explained in the model 

documentation available on the Board’s website, that model uses a set of well-studied longer-run 

economic relationships that have proven to be useful in a variety of economic conditions and 

modeling frameworks.  These include Okun’s Law, a Phillips Curve, and an inertial Taylor 

Rule.97  The Board acknowledges that increasing the predictability of the paths of scenario 

variables in this way could reduce the dynamism of the stress test or incent firms to optimize 

their portfolios in ways that reduce capital requirements, perhaps without a commensurate 

reduction in risk.  However, the guides and the model are constructed to remain flexible enough 

to ensure that the Board can adjust the severely adverse scenario to capture emerging risks and 

changes in the level of systemic risk since the previous stress test in a timely fashion.  This 

flexibility includes the ability to increase scenario severity when systemic risks may have built 

up during robust economic expansions or periods when risk appetite is high or to avoid adding 

sources of procyclicality through the stress test.  The proposal continues to ensure that the 

scenarios maintain a minimum severity level, even when economic and financial conditions are 

strained.  Setting a floor for the severity of the scenario is appropriate because risks that built up 

during an economic expansion can persist at financial intermediaries during downturns and 

96 This approach is consistent with how the Board has designed recent stress test scenarios.  See id. at 6659.   

97 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  

Page 83 of 294 

 
 
because firms that are under stress sometimes take imprudent risks that they believe will 

facilitate recovery.98   

The Board also considered that employing the guides or the macroeconomic model for 

stress testing sometimes may reduce the severity of some aspects of the scenario relative to what 

the currently less-constrained scenario design process would achieve, and in other cases it may 

result in higher severity for some aspects of the scenario than might otherwise be the case.  The 

flexibility in the guides should be sufficient for the Board to account for those eventualities by 

choosing offsetting values across multiple guides that create the appropriate overall severity of 

the scenario.   

Question 40: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using guides and the 

macroeconomic model for stress testing to guide the setting of scenario variables in the 

severely adverse scenario?  What, if any, alternatives to using a macroeconomic model to 

set the projection paths of other variables should the Board consider?  

F.  Scenario Design Principles Derived from Stress Testing Literature: Severity, Credibility, 

and Procyclicality  

In designing the guides for the construction of the severely adverse scenario presented in 

this framework, the Board is informed by the stress testing literature, which provides certain 

principles for scenario design,99 which are also reflected in the Board’s Stress Testing Policy 

Statement.100  First, the literature emphasizes the need for adequately severe scenarios, even 

98 See J. Peek & E. Rosengren, Unnatural Selection, Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan, 
95 AM. ECON. REV. 1144–66 (2005).

when the economy and financial system are in a stressed condition—complementing the Board’s 

principle of conservatism.101  Second, the literature offers insights on how historical data should 

inform the design of an adequately severe scenario, augmenting the Board’s recession approach.  

Third, the literature highlights the need for stress tests to avoid adding to other sources of 

procyclicality in the financial system.  In explaining the paths for variables in the severely 

adverse scenario, the guides provide specific applications of these principles, while this 

introduction provides an overview of their general meaning and rationale.  

The first principle derived from the literature concerns the need for sufficiently severe 

scenarios.  Plainly, insufficient stress test severity can lead to adverse outcomes.  Inadequately 

assessed risks lead to an underassessment of the associated credit losses and capital needs—the 

basic source of failures of many financial institutions during the 2007–2009 financial crisis 

which the Board’s stress tests are meant to avoid.  Frame et al. (2015) provide an in-depth 

analysis of how the assessment of risks (or stress test) conducted by the Office of the Federal 

Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) actually contributed to the failures of the Federal 

National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 

(Freddie Mac).102  Importantly, stress tests must be adequately severe both in good times and in 

bad.   

In the context of stress testing during crises, in particular, there are additional arguments 

against insufficient stress test severity.  Schuermann (2014) and Judge (2022) argue that 

insufficiently severe stress test scenarios can erode credibility and trust and impede timely and

adequate policy responses to ongoing crisis developments, thereby exacerbating a downturn.103  

Bernanke (2013) also highlights that stress tests in times of crisis should provide anxious 

investors with credible information about prospective losses.104  This literature points to the 

importance of sufficiently severe scenarios for the health of the financial system, including by 

maintaining credibility with the public and financial markets.   

Further evidence for the importance of sufficiently stressful scenarios to maintaining 

public credibility comes from past U.S. stress tests.  For example, the rapid deterioration in the 

U.S. economy in early 2009 led to realized unemployment rates that approached the peak of the 

unemployment rate path in the severely adverse scenario used for the Supervisory Capital 

Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009.105  In fact, the scenario peak for the unemployment rate 

hypothesized would reach only 8.9 percent at the end of 2009, but as of March 2009 the 

unemployment rate measured 8.5 percent and ultimately the unemployment rate peaked at 10 

percent in October of 2009.106  Because the results of the SCAP determined the amount of 

capital that firms needed to raise in financial markets or through the Treasury’s Capital

106 A similar concern related to insufficient scenario severity followed the announcement of the European Union’s 
stress tests in 2018, with the criticism that the assumptions were milder than conditions in the 2007–2009 financial 
crisis.  See F. Guarascio, “EU’s 2018 Stress Test too Mild, Spared Weaker States - Auditors”, REUTERS (Jul. 10,

Assistance Program, a scenario that turned out to be insufficiently severe could have left some 

firms undercapitalized and failed to achieve the goal of stabilizing the financial system.107   

This example helps demonstrate the importance of the principle of severity when 

considering historical data and current conditions in the construction of an adequately severe 

scenario.  While unemployment rates are discussed at length in the unemployment guide below, 

the maximum level of 8.9 percent specified in the 2009 SCAP, at the time, was well beyond the 

level reached in most post-war recessions.  At the time the scenario was issued, a projected 

increase to 8.9 percent was thus very severe compared to outcomes over the past quarter century, 

but nonetheless proved lower than the actual realized peak in 2009.   

That experience reinforces the need for the framework to support variable paths that 

exceed levels observed in the historical data.  Choosing a historical scenario has a price—“it 

does not test for anything new.”108  While the recession approach dictates that variable 

movements follow historical recessions, when current conditions are already extreme, a credible 

scenario may replicate historical recessions in terms of the size of movements previously 

observed, leading to levels of variables that may exceed historical levels.  Several of the guides 

in this framework allow, at times, for variables to exceed their historical range, either in levels or 

in changes, in order to maintain adequate severity.   

Ultimately, no single scenario can account for all potential contingencies.  Therefore, the 

severely adverse scenario used in the Board’s annual stress test must be sufficiently severe to 

107 An explanation of the synergy between the SCAP and CAP is available here: Supervisory Capital Assessment

ensure that banks will be resilient to a range of alternative and plausible scenarios that could 

generate net losses that are of similar magnitudes.109   

At the same time, the Board recognizes that the severity of the annual stress tests 

potentially can have unintended effects on firms’ operations.  For instance, the academic 

literature finds that stress tests improve financial stability by reducing riskier bank lending.110  

Ensuring that firms are appropriately capitalized for the risks they are taking is a goal of stress 

testing; however, if those effects are not well aligned with the true riskiness of a particular type 

of loan, then stress tests could unintentionally reduce banks’ credit supply.  For instance, some 

evidence exists that counties in which stress tested banks had high market share may have 

experienced a lower supply of credit to small and young businesses, which are generally 

considered riskier than established businesses but can generate a disproportionate share of 

growth in employment and income.111  However, other research concludes that businesses 

largely offset the reduction in loans from banks that participate in the stress tests with other 

sources of credit.  Those sources include loans from smaller banks not in the stress tests,112 debt 

issuance in capital markets, or loans from nonbank financial institutions.113  Moreover, these 

potential unintended effects on credit supply by stress tested firms must be weighed against the 

benefits, discussed above, that more credible stress tests bring to the economy and the financial

system.  By ensuring that firms have sufficient quantity and quality of loss-absorbing capital to 

cover the risks that they are taking, the stress tests ensure the resilience and stability of the 

banking sector even in circumstances when stresses take unexpected forms.   

The balance of those advantages and disadvantages of scenario severity can change over 

time.  Losses at financial institutions are more likely to arise when the economy slows.  Profits 

are more robust during periods of economic growth, in turn increasing resources available to 

cover future losses.  In other words, capital is naturally procyclical, having an underlying 

tendency towards a positive correlation with financial conditions.  Moreover, when underlying 

conditions are favorable and firm losses are low, firms sometimes project forward an expectation 

for low losses, paving the way to take more risk.114  Conversely, when conditions are bad, firms 

may overcompensate and restrict credit even to otherwise creditworthy borrowers, exacerbating 

the downturn.  Thus, firms’ behavior may amplify underlying procyclicality.   

Stress tests could, through different designs, either amplify or mitigate this procyclicality.  

If stress tests are always more severe in bad times, despite an expectation that conditions could 

soon improve, then this severity would add undue stress to the financial system, reducing 

financial intermediation with negative implications for the macroeconomy.  That said, the 

purpose of the stress test scenarios is not to serve as an explicit countercyclical offset to the 

financial system, but rather to ensure that the firms are properly capitalized to withstand severe 

economic and financial conditions.  Hence, the Board adopts a middle path, seeking to specify 

the severely adverse scenario to avoid adding sources of procyclicality to the financial system, 

neither explicitly mitigating any existing procyclical tendencies nor magnifying them.  Indeed, 

114 See A. Berger & G. Udell, The institutional memory hypothesis and the procyclicality of bank lending behavior,

banks,” Remarks before the Independent Community Bankers of America (Mar. 8, 2000) (“Greenspan (2000)”),

Kohn and Liang (2019) argue that the ability to adjust elements that potentially add 

procyclicality can be a major benefit of stress tests as “banks with forward-looking, less-

procyclical capital buffers will not pull back as much when a downturn occurs.”115   

In summary, in formulating the guides presented in this framework, the Board embraces 

three principles suggested by the literature: the importance of severity, the importance of 

credibility, and the importance of not adding to procyclicality.   

Stress Testing Literature and the Principle of Flexibility   

When considering these principles in light of the recession approach and the scenario 

narrative, the Board identified the importance of maintaining flexibility in the guides.  While the 

Board intends to increase the transparency, public accountability, and predictability of stress tests 

through this proposal, these goals should not come at the expense of the overall effectiveness of 

the Board’s stress tests.   

For instance, predictability and transparency could be achieved with a completely 

specified, entirely formulaic scenario that leaves no flexibility.  However, simple, fixed guides 

may not achieve at least one of the goals of severity, credibility, or not adding to procyclicality.  

A guide that always increased unemployment to a fixed level, say 10 percent, may not be 

credible or severe were the unemployment rate already at or close to that level.  A guide that 

always increased unemployment by a fixed amount, say 4 percent, could add to procyclicality by 

implying lower losses when unemployment was low in good times and higher losses when 

unemployment was high in bad times.  More sophisticated formulations might improve on 

simple rules by accounting for the factors affecting firms’ balance sheets and overall economic

and financial conditions.  For many types of economic indicators used in the Board’s scenario 

framework, however, a fixed rule for the design of a scenario variable that satisfied the principles 

related to procyclicality and severity laid out above could require a complex structure that would 

violate the Board’s principle of simplicity.116   

A lack of simplicity is not, however, the only concern with a framework that eliminates 

flexibility.  Unexpected shocks occur, like oil embargoes, national house price collapses, and 

pandemics.  Moreover, the implications of these shocks are often not readily captured in 

concurrent data, especially their future effects on the economy and financial stability in the 

United States, and so on firms’ future financial condition.  Maintaining a degree of flexibility 

would allow the scenarios to adapt to evolving conditions while adhering to the principles 

outlined above.   

In specifying the guides in this framework, the Board seeks to maintain flexibility by 

specifying ranges for the peak or trough value, the timing of that value, or the speed of 

adjustment for many of the variables.  The amount of flexibility in the guides, as measured by 

the size of ranges specified, is calibrated to be as narrow as possible while adhering to the 

principles laid out above and is based on research and analysis of the behavior of those variables 

during past recessions, consistent with the recession approach, or periods of stress in financial 

markets.  In addition to suggesting typical ranges within which scenarios will vary, the Board 

seeks to provide explanations of how the guide flexibility would be applied in different economic 

and financial conditions.   

116 Alongside conservatism, simplicity is one of the Board’s principles for supervisory stress testing.  See 12 CFR 
252, Appendix B. 

Page 91 of 294 

 
 
Generally speaking, the Board would design a more severe path for the scenario variables 

when it judged the level of systemic risks to be high, and a less severe path for the scenario 

variables when it judged systemic risks to be low.  In some cases, the level of systemic risk can 

be tied to the level of specific indicators.  For instance, when the unemployment rate is very 

high, the level of risk aversion also tends to be high, and that causes firms to reduce risk across 

their various business lines.  In other cases, the Board would consider overall assessments by 

economists, supervisors, and financial market experts to assess the level of systemic risks, which 

typically incorporate many of the specific indicators mentioned in the discussions of individual 

guides below, when it is difficult to do so using individual or small sets of scenario variables.117  

Therefore, the Board expects that it may choose to have similar severities for variable 

values in an annual scenario for those variables where the Board retains discretion within 

established ranges of the proposed guides.  This expectation reflects the Board’s consistent view 

that annual scenarios are not forecasts of potential future outcomes in the baseline or in a 

hypothetical stress environment.  Establishing variable values with similar severity levels 

enhances the transparency and predictability of the annual scenarios, and reflects an expectation 

that these variables are likely to experience stress concurrently in a hypothetical stress scenario.  

As discussed below, if the Board were to determine that a specific salient risk should be 

addressed in a particular annual stress test, it would provide a specific assessment of that risk and 

the rationale for an alternative calibration of the variable’s severity in the scenario disclosure for 

comment. 

117 For examples of relevant statistical analyses, see, e.g., V. Acharya et al., Measuring Systemic Risk, 30 REV. OF 
FIN. STUDIES 2–47 (Jan. 2017); T. Adrian & M. Brunnermeier, CoVaR, 106 AM. ECON. REV. 1705–41 (Jul. 2016).   

Page 92 of 294 

 
 
While flexibility allows scenarios to adapt to fast-evolving conditions, the guides in this 

framework are based on long-lasting structural features of the economy.  Macroeconomic 

history, however, features many examples where new data have contradicted long-held beliefs 

about underlying structural relationships.  Also, the financial system is constantly evolving, 

presenting new risks and vulnerabilities.  The relatively narrow ranges in the guides may not 

always allow for a fulsome response by the scenarios to significant developments.  Therefore, the 

Board also sets out expectations for circumstances that could require additional flexibility in 

setting the specifications of the variables in the stress tests, so that the public can anticipate 

where the Board could adopt a specification that differs from those identified in the guides in this 

proposal.  For instance, if events occur that alter the historical severity of a given variable, the 

Board could incorporate that data in its evaluation of the appropriate path for a given variable in 

annual scenarios that occur following such an event.  The Board continuously monitors the 

macroeconomy and the financial system.  If ongoing developments warrant, the Board may 

revisit this framework and adjust guides.   

Finally, the increased predictability and transparency of the scenario as specified in this 

framework may allow firms to adjust their portfolios to reduce capital requirements, perhaps 

without a commensurate reduction in risk.  While the Board acknowledges this possibility, the 

Board expects that the principle of severity embraced in this framework will produce scenarios 

that adequately test such risks.  Flexibility is maintained to allow scenarios to adapt to evolving 

conditions, not to reduce predictability and transparency.  Indeed, the ranges of flexibility 

specified, especially when considered alongside the guidance offered regarding the conditions 

under which that flexibility might be employed, result in highly transparent and predictable 

scenario paths.  Overall, the Board finds that the degree of flexibility and the goals of 

Page 93 of 294 

 
transparency and predictability are well balanced by this proposal, given the other requirements 

for designing effective and credible stress tests.   

Summary of Scenario Design Principles  

In formulating the guides presented in this framework, the Board is proposing to continue 

to use a recession approach, where the severely adverse scenario reflects conditions that 

characterize post-war U.S. recessions.  To implement this approach, the Board adopts a specific 

scenario narrative in which a severe shock to financial markets propagates through the economy 

and results in a severe, prolonged recession most similar to that of the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis.  The Board provides a qualitative description of the scenario informing the hypothetical 

recession that the scenario reflects.  In choosing specific scenario paths, the Board recognizes a 

need for the scenario to be adequately severe and credible, and to avoid adding to 

procyclicality.118  Finally, in this pursuit, the guides maintain a degree of flexibility to adapt to 

evolving economic and financial conditions.  The Board continues to expect that there will be 

some important instances when it will be appropriate to augment the recession approach with 

salient risks and to set variables’ values inside of, and in some cases, outside of the ranges and 

values provided in the guides in the Scenario Design Policy Statement.  

Question 41: What are the advantages and disadvantages of selecting the scenario design 

principles described in this section? Are there other principles that the Board should 

118 Assumptions that are meant to avoid adding procyclicality may add a degree of uncertainty to the path of 
the stress test scenario, relative to an assumption that is neutral to current economic conditions.  However, the 
proposed variable guides and the model used to design the macroeconomic scenario would promote 
the predictability of the scenario and would help reduce year-to-year volatility of the stress test and the resulting 
capital requirements.  This flexibility is particularly useful for the Board when the economy enters a recession and 
the credit quality of the banks’ borrowers deteriorates, because a less-flexible scenario design framework could 
result in a significantly larger increase in capital requirements and hence a further drag on economic activity relative 
to the previous year than would the proposed framework. 

Page 94 of 294 

 
 
weigh along with these principles?  Should the Board develop guidance for how it would 

weigh these principles in selecting values in annual scenario narratives?  

Question 42: What considerations should the Board evaluate when determining whether to 

set a given scenario variable independently of other variables in the annual scenario, or 

at similar levels of severity across multiple variables?   

Common Components of Scenario Path Guides  

The guides in this framework set out paths for each variable over the 13 quarters in the 

severely adverse scenario.  The stress test requires projections of 13 quarters worth of losses to 

determine capital ratios at the end of 9 quarters of the scenario, because loss provisions in quarter 

9 are affected by firm performance in quarters 10 to 13.  To describe these paths, most guides 

adopt a simple framework involving the following four parameters: the jump-off; the peak or 

trough; the timing of the peak or trough; and the trajectory from jump-off to peak or trough.  The 

purpose of publishing these components is to increase the transparency and public accountability 

of the stress test scenario by communicating how the variable would behave throughout the 

scenario period.  In calibrating these parameters, the guides explain their rationale in applying 

the recession approach along with the scenario narrative and the three principles for scenario 

design described above.   These parameters are described as follows:   

Jump-off: Jump-off values are important for informing the overall state of the economy in 

the scenarios, often affecting the specific levels achieved by the other parameters of the variable 

guide and informing the exercise of flexibility as specified in the guides.  In the scenario, the 

jump-off value is the value of the variable in the quarter preceding the scenario.  For most 

variables, the jump-off value is easily determined from published data at the time the scenario is 

released to the public.  However, for some variables the jump-off value is not available prior to 

Page 95 of 294 

 
the date that the Board must finalize the annual scenarios for publication, so an estimate is used; 

these details are described in the individual guides.  A separate issue involves choosing the 

appropriate historical jump-off date in the Board’s analysis underlying the calibration of the 

guides.  In many cases, stresses developed over time and a specific jump-off date or quarter for a 

particular period of stress may not be clearly identifiable.  For instance, the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis had multiple newsworthy events—the suspension of redemptions from money market 

mutual funds by BNP Paribas in August 2007, the failure of Bear Stearns in February 2008, and 

the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.  Therefore, the Board uses a range of 

quarters around the beginning of an identified recession or period of market stress to determine 

the jump-off values.  The Board determined that using the most extreme value of the variable in 

the four quarters before, and the first quarter of, the National Bureau of Economic Research 

(NBER) recession date or documented financial stress event as the starting point for the analysis 

supporting the calibration of the severity of the guides was most consistent with the Board’s 

stress testing principle of conservatism.  Each guide provides further details on selection of 

relevant reference periods.  

Peak or trough: The paths in the guide specify that each variable in the scenario will 

either increase or decrease from its jump-off value.  If it increases, it will reach a maximum or 

peak value during the scenario.  If it decreases, it will reach a minimum or trough value during 

the scenario.  For example, during the scenario, unemployment initially increases to a peak 

value, while house prices decrease to a trough value.  Each guide provides details on how the 

Board expects to determine the level of this peak or trough and the rationale for this 

determination.  In general, more extreme values are more stressful, and the specific levels of the 

Page 96 of 294 

 
peak or trough often depend on the jump-off values in line with the principles of severity, 

credibility, and not adding to procyclicality.  

Trajectories from jump-off to peak or trough: This parameter describes the values 

between the jump-off and peak or trough with a straight line (linear) function, a nonlinear 

function, or by specifying the proportion of the change from jump-off to peak or trough that will 

obtain in each of the intervening quarters.  Two further notes on trajectories: first, trajectories are 

frequently described as either frontloaded, meaning that larger changes occur earlier in the 

trajectory, or backloaded, meaning that larger changes occur later in the trajectory.  Depending 

on the variable, frontloading and backloading affect the overall severity of the scenario by having 

stressful changes earlier or lasting longer.  The individual guides discuss this issue.  Second, 

while several of the guides specify precise mathematical formulas for trajectories, for example 

linear (straight line) trajectories, rounding conventions—such as rounding to the first decimal 

place—for the published scenario may result in small differences from the result specified by the 

underlying formula.  These rounding conventions result in small changes to scenario variables 

that tend not to affect overall severity.  Instead, such rounding conventions are meant to help 

simplify the communication of the scenario to the public. 

The Board also considered the appropriate trajectory of variables after they reach the 

peak or trough and the appropriate end value.  This analysis confirmed that the range of end 

values used in past stress tests are generally supported by historical analysis combined with the 

stress testing principle of conservatism.  The end value describes the value of the variable in the 

last (13th) quarter of the scenario.  In applying the recession approach to calibrating end-values, 

the Board considers the values of a variable within a 10-15 quarter window after the beginning of 

the recession or other identified financial stress event, instead of simply taking the value of the 

Page 97 of 294 

 
variable in the 13th quarter.  This range of values allows the Board to better assess outliers or 

other interactions between the data and the annual scenario narrative than other calibration 

methods.  This flexibility also helps accommodate choices that account for the highly variable 

lengths of historical recessions.  The Board expects that for most variables determined by guides, 

the recovery trajectories between the peak or trough and end value typically should follow a 

roughly linear path that proportionally allocates the change across the relevant time remaining to 

the end of the scenario.  A roughly linear recovery reflects a preference for simplicity and 

transparency.  For variables determined by the Board’s macroeconomic model for stress testing, 

the end values and related trajectory from the peak or trough generally will be determined by the 

model.  

Timing of peak or trough: The guides for each variable set out the quarter of the scenario 

in which the variable path reaches its peak or trough.  Generally, these occur earlier for fast 

moving variables and later for slow moving variables.  Depending on the variable, either earlier 

or later timing may be more stressful, and there may be some flexibility in the timing of the peak 

or trough.   

In developing this framework, the Board considered a number of alternative 

specifications, both for specific variables and for the overall approach.  Some of these 

alternatives are described in greater detail within the discussion of each proposed guide in 

Section IX.G of this Supplementary Information.   

As described in the Scenario Design Policy Statement, the Board considered alternatives 

to the recession approach for the overall design of the severely adverse scenario, including a 

probabilistic approach.  The probabilistic approach would construct a baseline forecast from a 

large-scale macroeconomic model and identify a scenario that would have a specific probabilistic 

Page 98 of 294 

 
likelihood, given the baseline forecast.  The Board believes that, at this time, the recession 

approach is better suited for developing the severely adverse scenario than a probabilistic 

approach because it guarantees a recession of some specified severity.  In contrast, the 

probabilistic approach requires the choice of an extreme tail outcome—relative to baseline—to 

characterize the severely adverse scenario (e.g., a five percent or a one percent tail outcome).  In 

practice, this choice is difficult as adverse economic outcomes are typically thought of in terms 

of how variables evolve in an absolute sense rather than how far from the baseline they lie in the 

probability space.  In this sense, a scenario featuring a recession may be somewhat clearer and 

more straightforward to communicate.  Finally, the probabilistic approach relies on estimates of 

uncertainty around the baseline scenario and such estimates are in practice model-dependent.  

The Board also considered two types of alternative specifications for each of the guides.  

First, the Board considered a more-prescriptive approach, in which the guides set a typical peak 

or trough value and a specific quarter in which that value would obtain, usually either at the most 

severe end of the range specified in the proposed guide or at the mid-point of the range.  A guide 

set at the most severe end of the range would be consistent with the principle of conservatism 

and provide a high degree of transparency and predictability.  In contrast, the lack of flexibility 

in such a guide would reduce the ability of the Board to respond appropriately to risks that are 

apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial conditions and could potentially add to 

procyclical forces during economic booms or stressful periods.  A guide benchmarked to the 

midpoint of the range might not be credible during periods of high vulnerability, while still being 

too severe when stresses were already present.   

Second, the Board considered that guides could have larger ranges for the potential peak 

or trough values or the timing of the peak or trough than the proposed guides.  Larger ranges 

Page 99 of 294 

 
would increase the Board’s ability to capture risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of 

economic and financial conditions and to adjust to procyclical forces but would be less 

predictable and transparent.  In general, the Board expects the lower end of the range chosen for 

the proposed guides to represent the least amount of stress that would be deemed credible, while 

the higher end of the ranges already reflects the most severe plausible realizations of the variable.  

The proposed ranges for the guides are benchmarked to historical experience while still 

providing some ability to move beyond the upper or lower end of the historical range if 

circumstances dictate.  In consideration of these factors and the principles discussed above in this 

section, therefore, the Board expects that the disadvantages from the loss of transparency and 

predictability from guides with larger ranges generally would be larger than the advantages 

stemming from more flexibility in the wider ranges of such guides.   

In each case, the proposed and some specific examples of alternative guides are both 

discussed.  While the Board views the alternative guides as reasonable, the proposed guides have 

significant advantages over the considered alternatives.  However, the purpose of the alternative 

guide discussion is to invite comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to 

transparently lay out the Board’s present decision making in not adopting it.  

Question 43: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative guides?  Should 

the Board consider adopting any of the alternative guides?  What, if any, other guides 

should the Board consider in addition to the alternative guides considered?  

G.  Description of Variable Guides in the Severely Adverse Scenario 

Unemployment Rate 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including the 

unemployment rate of the civilian non-institutional population aged 16 and over (unemployment 

Page 100 of 294 

 
rate).119  As described in the previous sections, the Board intends to use a recession approach to 

develop the severely adverse scenario.  The most common features of recessions are increases in 

the unemployment rate and contractions in aggregate incomes and economic activity.  For this 

and the following reasons, the Board intends to use the unemployment rate as the primary basis 

for specifying the severely adverse scenario.  First, the unemployment rate is likely the most 

representative single summary indicator of adverse economic conditions.  Second, in comparison 

to GDP, labor market data have traditionally featured more prominently than GDP in the set of 

indicators that the NBER reviews to inform its recession dates.120  Third and finally, the growth 

rate of potential output can cause the size of the decline in GDP to vary between recessions.  

While changes in the unemployment rate can also vary over time due to demographic factors, 

this seems to have more limited implications over time relative to changes in potential output 

growth.  The unemployment rate used in the severely adverse scenario will reflect an 

unemployment rate that has been observed in severe post-war U.S. recessions, measuring 

severity by changes in the unemployment rate and GDP.121 

The Board uses a quarterly average of the monthly unemployment rate data in the stress 

test scenarios.  The Board uses a quarterly average of unemployment for several reasons.  

Unemployment and, importantly, related variables such as disposable income (discussed below) 

119 The Board uses the quarterly average of seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rates for the civilian, non-
institutional population aged 16 years and older series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (series LNS14000000). 

120 More recently, a monthly measure of GDP has been added to the list of indicators. 
121  Even though all recessions feature increases in the unemployment rate and contractions in incomes and 
economic activity, the size of this change has varied over post-war U.S. recessions.  Table 5 documents the 
variability in the depth of post-war U.S. recessions.  There is no universal agreement on how to categorize recession 
severity.  For the purposes of this guide, the following categorization is employed: Recessions where the decline in 
real GDP and the increase in the unemployment rate are less than 1.5 percent or 1.5 percentage points, respectively, 
are considered mild; recessions where the decline in real GDP is 2.5 percent or more, or the increase in the 
unemployment rate is 3 percentage points or more, are considered severe; all other recessions are considered 
moderate. 

Page 101 of 294 

 
 
can feature volatility at higher frequencies unrelated to underlying market conditions (e.g., 

unexpected weather events or a baseline level of statistical variation in the survey responses); 

quarterly averages smooth out the volatility that is present at monthly frequencies.  Overall, 

using quarterly averages strikes a balance between being sensitive enough to capture broader 

economic trends and stable enough to avoid overreaction to short-term fluctuations.  The 

Scenario Design Policy Statement outlines certain information regarding the peak level and 

timing of the peak level of the unemployment rate for the severely adverse scenario.122  This 

proposed guide conforms with and expands on that statement, providing greater predictability, 

transparency, and specificity with regards to the trajectory to peak value.  The remainder of this 

section is outlined as follows.  An overview of the unemployment guide components is given in 

Table 4.  This is followed by a reiteration of the Scenario Design Policy Statement which 

describes the peak component of the unemployment rate and its timing.  After that, a discussion 

of the trajectory to peak value is provided.  

The purpose of publishing these components is to increase the predictability, public 

accountability, and transparency of the stress test scenario by communicating how the variable 

will behave throughout the scenario period.

a. 

Peak Value and Timing of Peak  

The Board is proposing to retain the guide established in the Scenario Design Policy 

Statement, with some additional explanations provided here.  The Board anticipates that the 

severely adverse scenario will feature an unemployment rate that increases between 3 to 5 

Page 103 of 294 

 
  
  
  
 
 
percentage points from its initial level over the course of 6 to 8 calendar quarters.123  The initial 

level will be set based on the conditions at the time that the scenario is designed.  However, if a 3 

to 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate does not raise the level of the 

unemployment rate to at least 10 percent—the average level to which it has increased in severe 

recessions—the path of the unemployment rate in most cases will be specified so as to raise the 

unemployment rate to at least 10 percent.  

This methodology is intended to generate scenarios that feature stressful outcomes but do 

not add to procyclicality in the financial system and macroeconomy.124  When the economy is in 

the early stages of a recovery, the unemployment rate in a baseline scenario generally trends 

downward, resulting in a larger difference between the path of the unemployment rate in the 

severely adverse scenario and the baseline scenario, resulting in a severely adverse scenario that 

is relatively more intense.  Conversely, in a sustained strong expansion—when the 

unemployment rate may be below the level consistent with full employment—unemployment in 

a baseline scenario generally trends upward, resulting in a smaller difference between the path of 

the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario and the baseline scenario, resulting in a 

severely adverse scenario that is relatively less intense.  Historically, a 3 to 5 percentage point 

increase in the unemployment rate is reflective of stressful conditions.  As illustrated in Table 5, 

over the last half-century, the U.S. economy has experienced five severe post-war recessions.  In 

all of these recessions excluding COVID-19, the unemployment rate increased 3 to 5 percentage 

123 Six to eight quarters is the average number of quarters for which a severe recession lasts plus the average number 
of subsequent quarters over which the unemployment rate continues to rise. The variable length of the timeframe 
reflects the different paths to the peak unemployment rate depending on the severity of the scenario. 

124 For a discussion on the benefits of adequate severity, see, e.g., Judge 2022, supra note 103.  For a discussion on 
the benefits of avoiding adding sources of procyclicality to the financial system, see, e.g., D. Kohn & N. Liang,

points, and in the three most recent of these recessions excluding COVID-19, the unemployment 

rate reached a level between 8 percent and 11 percent.125  

Under this method, if the initial unemployment rate were low—as it would be after a 

sustained long expansion—the unemployment rate in the scenario would increase to a level as 

high as what has been seen in past severe recessions.  However, if the initial unemployment rate 

were already high—as would be the case in the early stages of a recovery—the unemployment 

rate would exhibit a change as large as what has been seen in past severe recessions.  

The Board expects that the typical increase in the unemployment rate in the severely 

adverse scenario will be about 4 percentage points.  However, as discussed in Section IX.F of 

this Supplementary Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increase in unemployment 

based on its views of the status of cyclical systemic risk.  More specifically, the Board would be 

more likely to set the unemployment rate at the higher end of the range if the Board expects that 

cyclical systemic risks are high (as it would be after a sustained long expansion), and 

alternatively would be more likely to set the unemployment rate to the lower end of the range if 

cyclical systemic risks are low (as it would be in the earlier stages of a recovery), provided doing 

so remained consistent with the goal of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to 

withstand severe economic and financial conditions.  This may result in a scenario that is slightly 

more intense than normal if the Board expects that cyclical systemic risks were increasing in a 

period of robust expansion.126   

125 The unemployment rate was 8 percent in 1975Q1, 11 percent in 1982Q4, and 9 percent in 2009Q2. 
126 Note, however, that the severity of the scenario would not reach an implausible level: even at the upper end of the 
range of unemployment-rate increases, the path of the unemployment rate would still be consistent with severe post-
war U.S. recessions.  However, historical values need not serve as a binding upper bound for the scenario peaks as 
discussed in the introductory section of this proposal. 

Page 105 of 294 

 
 
Conversely, it would also allow the Board to specify a scenario that is slightly less 

intense than normal in an environment where systemic risks appeared subdued, such as in the 

early stages of a recovery.  This choice would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to 

remaining stress, thereby exacerbating the initial adverse shock, and it would be particularly 

appropriate if the Board judges that firms are already taking steps to reduce their risk—for 

instance, by potentially restricting lending to otherwise qualified borrowers.  The Board expects 

that, in general, it would adopt a change in the unemployment rate of less than 4 percentage 

points when systemic risks are low or receding.  This might be the case when, along with other 

factors, the unemployment rate at the start of the scenarios is elevated but the labor market is 

judged to be strengthening and higher-than-usual credit losses stemming from previously 

elevated unemployment rates were already realized—or are in the process of being realized—and 

thus removed from firms’ balance sheets.127  However, even at the lower end of the range of 

unemployment-rate increases, the scenario would still be expected to feature an increase in the 

unemployment rate similar to what has been seen in about half of the severe recessions of the 

past 50 years.   

As indicated previously, if a 3 to 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate 

does not raise the level of the unemployment rate to 10 percent—the average level to which it 

has increased in severe recessions—the path of the unemployment rate will be specified so as to 

raise the unemployment rate to 10 percent.  Setting a floor for the unemployment rate at 10 

percent recognizes the fact that not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial 

127 Evidence of a strengthening labor market could include declines in weekly initial claims for unemployment, a 
declining unemployment rate, steadily expanding nonfarm payroll employment, or improving labor force 
participation.  Evidence that credit losses are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases, 
loan-loss provisions in excess of gross charge-offs, or losses being realized in securities portfolios that include 
securities that are subject to credit risk. 

Page 106 of 294 

 
 
intermediaries during robust expansions, but also that these risks are easily obscured by a 

buoyant environment.128   

In setting the increase in the unemployment rate, the Board will consider the extent to 

which analysis by economists, supervisors, and financial market experts finds cyclical systemic 

risks to be elevated (but difficult to be captured more precisely in one of the scenario’s other 

variables).129  In addition, the Board—in light of potential impending shocks to the economy and 

financial system—expects to also take into consideration the extent to which a scenario of some 

increased severity might be necessary for the results of the stress test and the associated 

supervisory actions to sustain public confidence in financial institutions.  Some indicators that 

would inform the Board’s decision would be the growth rate of real GDP and its trajectory in 

recent quarters as well as leading economic indicators, such as equity prices as these measures 

provide a broader perspective on the state and direction of the economy.  Consistent with the 

Scenario Design Policy Statement, the Board is mindful of sources of procyclicality in the 

financial system and in designing the severely adverse scenario.  While the Board designs the 

stress test scenarios to promote the proper capitalization of firms, the scenarios are not intended 

to serve as an explicit countercyclical offset to the financial system.130  

Alternative Peak Guide Options 

In preparing this proposal, the Board considered a guide that would choose a peak level 

for unemployment that is 4 percentage points higher than the jump-off value or 10 percent, 

whichever is higher.  This alternative has the advantage of being simpler, more predictable, and 

more transparent than the guide choice.  The Board views this alternative guide to be less 

128 See supra note 114.  
129 For relevant analyses, see supra note 117. 
130 See 12 CFR 252, Appendix A. 

Page 107 of 294 

 
 
desirable as it is less flexible and may end up being inadequately severe.  Furthermore, such lack 

of flexibility could potentially add to scenario procyclicality.  For example, in periods with 

already highly elevated unemployment rates above 7 percent, this alternative could result in 

unemployment rates of historically high levels at times when economic conditions were already 

depressed.  

Instead, the current guide, specifying the greater of an increase of 3 to 5 percentage 

points or 10 percent, acknowledges that the Board would be unlikely to consider larger changes 

in unemployment when its rate is already highly elevated.  As discussed in Section IX.F of this 

Supplementary Information, when the underlying conditions are favorable and firm losses are 

low, firms may project these tendencies forward, paving the way to take more risk.131  Similarly, 

as discussed previously, the ability to adjust elements that potentially add procyclicality can be a 

major benefit of stress tests.132 

b. 

Trajectory to Peak 

The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario would feature a trajectory to the 

peak unemployment rate that initially increases quickly with slower incremental increases.  The 

trajectory to peak will have a concave parabolic path starting from the value in the economy at 

the beginning of the scenario and reaching a peak at between 6-8 quarters.133  This approach for 

the trajectory to peak reflects several considerations.  First, this trajectory to peak features larger 

increases in unemployment in the early quarters of the scenario, reflecting a rapid and deep 

131 See Berrospide (2024) and Davydiuk (2024), supra note 113; Cortés (2021), supra note 112.  

132 See Berger (2004) and Greenspan (2000), supra note 114114.  

133 A concave curve is one with the property that any straight line drawn between two points on the curve lies on or 
below the curve. A parabolic path is a curve, x(t), that can be written as: x(t) = a(t^2) + b(t) + c for some constants a, 
b, and c. In this case, concavity implies a < 0. If x0 is the jump-off value, xpeak is the peak value, and tpeak is the peak 
2, b = 2*(xpeak-x0)/tpeak, 
quarter, then the parameters for the path are given by the following equations: a = (x0-xpeak)/tpeak
and c = x0.  Published scenario values may differ somewhat from this formula because of rounding conventions. 

Page 108 of 294 

 
 
deterioration in labor market conditions, in line with the scenario narrative discussed above and 

consistent with the principle that the severely adverse scenario be highly stressful as a rapid 

increase gives firms less time to adapt to changes.  Second, this trajectory to peak is consistent 

with theoretical economic models which often share the feature that the response of 

unemployment to a shock features initially large increases in unemployment with decreasing 

incremental changes up to the peak.134  Empirically, this general pattern can be seen, for 

example, in the impulse response function illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2 in the FEDS 

Note that evaluates empirical regularities in variable co-movement in stress test scenarios.135  

Third, while all recessions have differences in their specific paths of the unemployment rate, a 

concave trajectory to peak is broadly consistent with the data from severe recessions.  One 

indicator is to look at second differences, which are the change in changes, an approximation of 

the acceleration of a variable.136  Concave paths have negative second differences.  The second 

differences of the unemployment rate are negative on average for severe recessions, indicating a 

generally concave path with decreasing changes up to the peak. 

Finally, a trajectory with frontloading of increases in the unemployment rate has been a 

characteristic of all recent severely adverse scenarios, except for the second round of bank stress 

tests in September 2020.137 

134 See, e.g., Panel A of Figure 12 in N. Petrosky‐Nadeau & L. Zhang, Solving the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides 
model accurately, 8 Quantitative Economics 611–50 (Jul. 2017).  
135 See E. Afanasyeva et al., Evaluating Empirical Regularities in Variable Comovement in Stress Test Scenarios, 
FEDS Notes (Sep. 19, 2025), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3885. 
136 Given a time series x(t), the first difference is defined as y(t) = x(t) - x(t-1) and measures changes from one period 
to the next. The second difference is then defined as z(t) = y(t) - y(t-1) = (x(t) - x(t-1)) - (x(t-1) - x(t-2)) and measures 
the change in the rate of change, otherwise described as acceleration.  

137 This additional round of stress tests was performed due to the continued uncertainty from the COVID-19 event.  
As the scenarios were designed for the unique COVID-19 event, the Board does not anticipate future stress testing to 
closely follow this unique episode.

House Prices 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including house prices 

as measured by the Price Index for Owner-Occupied Real Estate (HPI).138  The Scenario Design 

Policy Statement outlined information regarding the formulation of house prices in the severely 

adverse scenario.  This guide conforms with and expands on that statement, providing further 

information on the data used in the construction of the house price path in the severely adverse 

scenario, including the timing of the trough value and the trajectory to the trough value.139  

Firms subject to the supervisory stress test have a substantial exposure to the residential 

real estate market.140  Given firms’ direct exposures, and the broader impact of the housing 

sector on household balance sheets and the macroeconomy, the Board’s methodology for 

supervisory stress tests incorporates house prices into a number of models.141  Moreover, house 

price build-ups sometimes precede episodes of banking stress, with a notable example being the 

2007–2009 financial crisis.  By incorporating house prices into macroeconomic scenarios, 

supervisory stress tests help ensure that firms subject to the stress test are prepared for a range of 

market outcomes, including periods of large declines in house prices directly affecting loan 

performance and firms’ balance sheets.  This helps maintain the overall stability and resilience of 

the financial system.  

138 Specifically, the Price Index for Owner-Occupied Real Estate, Z.1 (Financial Accounts of the United States), 
Federal Reserve Board series FL075035243.Q, divided by 1000. 
139 Trough value represents the minimum value achieved during the scenario. 

140 Regarding the importance of house prices to insured depository institutions generally, in 2025Q1, mortgages and 
mortgage-backed securities comprised more than 20 percent of FDIC insured firms’ assets (based on the ratio of 
Loans Secured by Real Estate, 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages, plus Mortgage-backed Securities, divided by

Page 110 of 294 

 
 
The Board uses a quarterly average frequency for this data in the supervisory stress test 

scenario.  Instead of using the monthly frequency at which the underlying data is available, the 

Board uses a quarterly average of house prices in the stress test scenario for several reasons.  

House prices and, importantly, related variables such as disposable income (discussed more 

below) can feature volatility at higher frequencies unrelated to underlying market conditions.  

For example, extreme weather can affect the demand for home purchases and employment 

during a particular month, and thus the prices paid in home transactions and income that month, 

notwithstanding market conditions.  Therefore, quarterly averages smooth out month-to-month 

volatility.  Overall, using quarterly averages strikes a balance between being sensitive enough to 

capture market trends and stable enough to avoid overreaction to short-term fluctuations in 

prices.   

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to the 

scenario design principles discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While 

doing so, the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the 

financial system.  In the context of house prices, these principles are applied in calibrating the 

key aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of the trough value, and the trajectory to 

trough value.  This approach helps ensure that the house price guide aligns with the established 

stress testing literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the financial system. This 

guide description is outlined as follows.  An overview of the house prices guide is given in 

Table 6.  This is followed by a reiteration of the Scenario Design Policy Statement which 

describes the trough value used in the construction of house prices.  After that, this guide 

provides a supplementary discussion of the construction of house prices in the severely adverse 

scenario, followed by a discussion of the other components of the trajectory of house prices.

a. 

Trough Value Component of the Guide 

The Board is proposing to retain the guide established in the Scenario Design Policy 

Statement to inform the trough of house prices in the scenario, with additional explanations 

provided here.  In most circumstances, the Board expects that the ratio of HPI to nominal per 

capita DPI (HPI-DPI ratio) falls by at least 25 percent or enough to bring the ratio down to the 

trough reached in the wake of the 2007–2009 financial crisis, which occurred in the first quarter 

of 2012, whichever is greater. 

Data- and Scenario- based Rationale for the Trough Value 

Declining house prices, which are an important source of stress to a firm’s balance sheet, 

are not a steadfast feature of recessions, and the historical relationship of national house prices 

with the unemployment rate is not strong.  Simply adopting their typical path in a severe 

recession would likely underestimate risks stemming from the housing sector.  This can be seen 

when considering regional housing recessions, which have occurred with greater frequency.  

Three examples include New England and California in the early 1990s, and Texas in the 1980s.  

While regional house price indices featured only moderate decreases, the ratios of price to 

Page 112 of 294 

 
 
income fell precipitously.  Further, in each case, the regional housing recession precipitated a 

regional banking crisis.142  

Assessing the procyclicality of house price paths over time is complicated by the fact that 

house prices—in contrast to the unemployment rate—have historically trended upward over 

time.  Therefore, instead of specifying the path of house prices directly, the Board expects to 

consider the ratio of the nominal HPI to nominal per capita DPI.  The HPI-DPI ratio does not 

exhibit an upward trend and, as such, provides an alternative way to assess the procyclicality of 

the scenarios’ house price paths.  Moreover, the HPI-DPI ratio is a commonly used valuation 

metric for the housing sector.143  

Under most circumstances, the Board expects the decline in the HPI-DPI ratio in the 

severely adverse scenario to be 25 percent from its starting value or enough to bring the ratio 

down to its trough during the 2007–2009 financial crisis, whichever is the larger decline.  The

143 While different authors have considered different measures of house prices or income, there is wide agreement in

maximum trough level specified in this guide is motivated by the data, corresponding to the level 

achieved in the wake of the 2007–2009 financial crisis, which reached a trough in the first 

quarter of 2012.  The minimum decline specified in this guide for the HPI-DPI ratio from its 

starting value, a 25 percent decline, is motivated by the data as well—such a fall reflects the 

average peak to trough fall in this ratio across the three national housing recessions identified by 

the Board, as shown in Table 7.144  While the average across housing recessions is heavily 

influenced by the steep decline in the 2007–2009 financial crisis, similar magnitude falls have 

occurred with greater frequency when considering the aforementioned regional housing 

recessions.145  

The minimum decline of 25 percent ensures adequate scenario severity, maintaining the 

credibility of the stress test while at the same time constraining the trough from becoming unduly 

contractionary and deviating too far from historically observed levels.146  Applying a larger value 

of a minimum decline (e.g., the 2007–2009 peak-to-trough fall of more than 40 percent) could 

result in a trough level that is unjustifiably far away from most historical movements, especially 

if it were applied during a period in which the HPI-DPI ratio were already at a low level.  

Alternately, specifying a maximum trough level higher than that experienced during the 2007–

2009 financial crisis might not allow the Board to adequately test firms’ resilience to potential 

shocks when home valuations are as elevated as they were in the mid-2000s. 

144 The national house-price retrenchments that occurred over the periods 1980–1985, 1989–1996, 2006–2011 are 
referred to in this document as housing recessions.  The date ranges of housing recessions are based on the timing of 
house-price retrenchments.  These dates were also associated with sustained declines in real residential investment, 
and the precise timings of housing recessions would likely be slightly different were they to be classified based on 
real residential investment in addition to house prices.  The ratios described in Table 7 are calculated based on 
nominal HPI and HPI-DPI ratios indexed to 100 in 2000:Q1. 

145 See infra note 148.  

146 If a future stress event causes the HPI-DPI to fall significantly below the 2007-2009 financial crisis trough, or 
perhaps just to that level, the Board will consider an update of the trough calibration to reflect that new empirical 
evidence in subsequent future tests. 

Page 114 of 294 

 
 
The construction of this part of the house prices guide reflects the goal of avoiding 

adding sources of procyclicality in the financial system.  Accordingly, the severely adverse 

scenario will feature smaller variable movements when those variables are less extreme, and the 

severely adverse scenario will feature larger variable movements when those variables are more 

extreme, generally up to a level at least as extreme as the 2007–2009 financial crisis.   

The recession approach provides further justification for the proposed calibration of the 

severity of the trough of house prices.  While national house prices and national unemployment 

do not exhibit a strong relationship in the data, research shows that unemployment in a 

household has a large effect on default rates, and that increases in local unemployment are 

correlated with decreases in local house prices.147  Similarly, regional housing recessions often 

feature increases in regional unemployment.148  Hence, the recession approach suggests that a 

scenario with a high peak level of unemployment should also feature a low nadir in house prices.

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale 

This subsection begins with a description of the construction of the house price series.  

This is followed by a description of the timing of the trough of HPI-DPI.  The subsection 

concludes with information regarding the trajectory to trough. 

Construction of House Prices from HPI-DPI 

Unlike the guides for some other variables, such as unemployment and equity prices, this 

guide does not directly specify a path for house prices in the severely adverse scenario.  Instead, 

this guide specifies a path for the HPI-DPI ratio.  The scenario projection for house prices is then 

calculated from this ratio using paths for DPI and population, as calculated by the 

macroeconomic model for stress testing that the Board has developed specifically to aid in 

communicating the stress test scenario to the public specified on the Board’s website.  The 

scenario projection for population is the same as that contemplated in the Baseline Scenario 

Guide, as described in Section IX.C of this Supplementary Information and in section 4.1 of the 

Scenario Design Policy Statement.  The scenario projection for house prices is then calculated as 

the HPI-DPI path, discussed in this guide, multiplied by nominal disposable income divided by 

population.  

Trough Value Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The Board expects that the trough of HPI-DPI typically 

should occur between quarter 8 and quarter 10 of the severely adverse scenario, as explained 

below.   

To support this range for the timing of the trough in house prices, the Board applied the 

recession approach and used the timing of unemployment peaks to calibrate the timing of the 

Page 116 of 294 

 
trough of HPI-DPI.  This benchmarking to the unemployment peak was necessary because house 

prices have more protracted cyclical dynamics than other scenario variables described in this 

framework.  The three major house price retrenchments indicated in Table 7 featured peak-to-

trough durations for HPI-DPI of between 19 and 30 quarters.  The full implications of such a 

protracted decline cannot be adequately assessed by including only a portion of that decline 

within the nine-quarter horizon of the annual stress tests, because the resilience of firms would 

be impacted importantly by investors’ perceptions of the expected future losses.149  Moreover, 

the practical difficulties presented by the difference between the length of historical housing 

cycles and the length of the stress test scenario is an example of why the Board expects to 

maintain the flexibility to use scenarios that are not exactly like historical scenarios.150  Together, 

these two notions, one practical and the other principled, require the Board to consider a more 

careful approach to reading the historical record in its determination of the timing of the trough 

value for HPI-DPI.  

Because the length of the severely adverse scenario cannot replicate the duration of 

historical housing recessions, the Board identified the subperiods within past housing recessions 

that featured the greatest declines in HPI-DPI to support its calibration of the trough within the 

scenario.  This choice reflects the principle of severity.  The Board considered three window 

lengths when calculating periods of maximum declines in HPI-DPI: 6, 9, and 13 quarters.151  The 

149 Supervisory stress tests consider results from the nine quarters following the jump-off quarter.  This and other 
guides specify a 13-quarter path because the calculation of provisions for losses are forward looking; that is, they 
depend on estimated losses in the subsequent four quarters.  Therefore, they require values for some macroeconomic 
variables to extend beyond the nine quarters that are counted in the stress test. 

150 See Schuermann (2014), supra note 99.   
151 These three window lengths were considered as they span the set that would satisfy the limited duration of the 
scenario and the need for severity discussed above.  

Page 117 of 294 

 
 
calculations in Table 7 include the trough-quarter of such windows, along with the percentage 

decline in HPI-DPI over each window. 

Under the recession approach, the Board calibrates other variables to be consistent with 

the scenario path for unemployment.  To compare the maximum decline in the HPI-DPI ratio 

with the peak in unemployment, the table also includes the timing of the peak quarter for 

unemployment along with the difference in timing between the peak unemployment rate and the 

end of the window.  For example, when considering the period 2005Q4–2012Q1 (Column 3, 

Table 8), the 6-quarter window with the greatest change in HPI-DPI is 2007Q2–2008Q4 (Row 2, 

Column 3).  This window featured a fall in the HPI-DPI ratio of 24.1 percent.  The end of this 

window, 2008Q4 is 4 quarters before the unemployment rate peaked in 2009Q4. 

On average, the quarter of the maximum decline in HPI-DPI over 6-quarter windows 

precedes the quarter of peak unemployment by 1.67 quarters.  The unemployment guide features 

a range for the peak in unemployment with a midpoint in quarter 7.  Therefore, to be consistent 

with some years’ contemplated path for unemployment, a 6-quarter window for the decline in 

HPI-DPI would have to start with the scenario jump-off quarter rather than the first quarter of the 

scenario.  Hence, the Board deemed a trough timing for HPI-DPI of 6 quarters as too short.   

More promisingly, the relationship between the peak of unemployment and the trough of 

the HPI-DPI ratio flips at longer horizons.  The unemployment peak quarter precedes the quarter 

of the maximum declines in HPI-DPI over 9 and 13 quarter windows by an average of 0.67 and 

2.33, respectively.  Therefore, trough timings of both 9 and 13 quarters would be broadly 

consistent with the length of the scenario and the timing of the unemployment peak within it.  Of 

these two options, the Board deems that the trough timing of HPI-DPI should occur around 

quarter 9 for two auxiliary reasons: First, an interior trough time allows for some subsequent 

Page 118 of 294 

 
recovery, mirroring the movement of unemployment and other variables in this framework.  

Second, a shorter duration to trough, all else equal, will result in a more severe scenario, 

consistent with the principal of conservatism.   

In addition, the maximum changes in HPI-DPI for the 6, 9, and 13 quarter subperiods 

associated with the 2007–2009 financial crisis are close to or larger than 25 percent.  Hence, this 

subperiod analysis also further supports the calibration of the trough level in this guide.   

Turning to a comparison with past scenarios, the selection of a range of quarter 8 to 10 

for the trough of HPI-DPI in the severely adverse scenario is broadly consistent with the timing 

of past scenarios.  In 2019 to 2022, the severely adverse scenario featured a trough in quarter 9.  

In 2023 to 2025, the severely adverse scenario featured a trough in quarter 7, as the Board 

assessed valuation pressures in residential real estate to be very elevated and wanted to ensure 

that the banking system remained resilient to a sudden correction in the housing market.  

Although that calibration of the guide would require the Board to explain its rationale for 

choosing an earlier trough going forward, the analysis presented above about the typical timing 

of house price troughs suggests that a trough between quarters 8 and 10 of the scenario usually 

would be sufficiently and credibly stressful.  In choosing the timing of the trough, the Board 

expects to choose an earlier trough when the level of systemic risks is high or rising and a later 

trough when the level of systemic risks is low or declining.  Housing market indicators such as 

recent trends in HPI-to-DPI ratios, house price growth, the growth rate of mortgage lending, or 

changes in mortgage lending standards are factors in that determination.  Conversely, when 

vulnerabilities or risks related to residential real estate and related lending are low or decreasing, 

the Board could consider a later trough.

Trajectory to Trough 

This guide specifies a trajectory to trough featuring 20 percent of the decline in the first 

quarter, 20 percent of the decline in the second quarter, and a linear trajectory to trough 

thereafter, subject to the rounding conventions mentioned in Section IX.F of this Supplementary 

Information.  As shown in Table 8, housing recessions tend to be protracted.  While the Board 

follows the recession approach, the other principles from the stress testing literature suggest that

a careful reading of the data is warranted.  To this end, when considering the windows with the 

most rapid declines in Table 8 above, further analysis shows that each housing recession featured 

quarters with declines near 20 percent.  In an application of the principle of conservatism, the 

Board finds that two quarters of 20 percent declines broadly fits the scenario narrative of a rapid 

decline in economic conditions and sentiment, while meeting the other principles set out in this 

guide; frontloaded declines are relatively more severe, so are consistent with the principles of 

conservatism, severity, and the need to consider possibilities somewhat outside the historical 

evidence.  The specification of linear declines thereafter was chosen in the interest of simplicity.   

Moreover, a rapid decline in house prices is consistent with the recession approach, in 

which other variables in the scenario are guided by the scenario trajectory for the unemployment 

rate, which features rapid initial deterioration.  In addition, rather than having HPI-DPI decline 

throughout the 13 quarter scenario as might be justified given the historical record, the Board 

expects that house prices in the severely adverse scenario will feature a moderate recovery after 

their trough⸺ again, consistent with the recession approach where variables follow from the 

general movements of the unemployment rate, which itself recovers after its trough⸺ a feature 

which moderates the severity of the initial decreases in house prices.  Turning to past scenarios, a 

moderately frontloaded trajectory to trough strikes a balance between recent scenarios.  

Scenarios from 2023 to 2025 featured strongly frontloaded declines, with more than 40 percent 

of the drop happening in the first quarter, and increasingly smaller drops to the trough.  

Frontloading the decline in this manner is consistent with the principle of conservatism and the 

advice from stress testing literature to consider features that are outside of historical experience 

when vulnerabilities are elevated.  The Board made a different decision with house price 

scenarios in 2021 and 2022, which featured a less stressful trajectory of initially small declines 

Page 121 of 294 

 
followed by a period of larger declines while the economy was recovering from the COVID-19 

recession.  Hence, a moderately frontloaded trajectory falls between these earlier and later 

scenarios.  The Board sees the reduction in flexibility in this component of the house price path 

as partially offset by the additional predictability and simplification that it provides.   

The Board expects that a scenario consistent with the level, timing, and trajectory to the 

trough of house prices specified by this guide will be at least somewhat more severe than the 

average of past housing recessions and sufficiently close to the house price correction associated 

with the 2007–2009 financial crisis.   

Commercial Real Estate Prices 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including commercial 

real estate prices as reported in the Board’s Z.1 statistical release.153  The Commercial Real 

Estate Price Index aggregates price indices across office, retail, industrial and other types of 

properties. 

In the supervisory stress test, commercial real estate prices capture a key part of the risks 

to firms from their commercial real estate exposures, which are reported by firms on FR Y-14Q, 

Schedule H.2.  Most firms subject to the supervisory stress test have a substantial exposure to the 

commercial real estate market.  Moreover, commercial real estate price build-ups often precede 

episodes of market stress.  By incorporating commercial real estate prices into macroeconomic 

scenarios, supervisory stress tests help ensure that firms subject to the stress test are prepared for 

a range of market conditions, including periods of large decline in commercial real estate prices 

153 The source for the data is the Commercial Real Estate Price Index, Z.1 Release (Financial Accounts of the United 
States), Federal Reserve Board.  This index is based on quarterly change of the Value Weighted Costar U.S. 
Composite Index Excluding Multifamily.

directly affecting the firms’ balance sheets.  This helps maintain the overall stability and 

resilience of the financial system. 

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to the 

scenario design principles discussed in the earlier Section IX.F of this Supplementary 

Information.  While doing so, the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of 

procyclicality into the financial system.  In the context of commercial real estate prices, these 

principles are applied in calibrating three key aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of 

the trough value, and the trajectory to trough value.  This approach ensures that the commercial 

real estate price guide aligns with the established stress testing literature while mitigating 

potential systemic risks for the financial system. 

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Table 9 includes an overview of the 

Board’s proposed guide for setting commercial real estate prices in the severely adverse scenario.  

The next subsection provides the data- and scenario-based rationale for the calibration of the 

trough component.  Afterward follows a discussion of the alternative trough option, comparing 

the implementation and caveats to the proposed guide description.  Finally, additional guide 

parameters for the trough timing and trajectory to trough value, and the rationale for their 

calibration are discussed.

a. 

Trough Value Component of the Guide 

The proposed guide stipulates that at the trough, commercial real estate prices will drop 

between 30 percent and 45 percent from the jump-off value.  The choice of the specific 

magnitude of drop within this range will be determined based on the overall level of cyclical 

systemic risk and an assessment of relevant indicators in the market as reflected by a range of 

commercial real estate indicators such as the level and change over preceding years in 

commercial real estate prices, commercial real estate capitalization rate (cap rate), lending 

standards on commercial real estate loans, rents, and vacancy rates, among other indicators.  The 

Board generally judges valuation pressures and the implied level of risk by looking at where 

recent observations of these relevant indicators are within their distributions. 

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Trough Value 

In line with the scenario design principles for setting the scenario severity, as discussed 

earlier in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the proposed guide takes into account 

the dynamics of a variety of commercial real estate market indicators, including but not limited 

to the growth rates of commercial real estate prices, changes in bank lending standards in the 

commercial real estate segment, and the commercial real estate capitalization rate over the past 

several years.  The consideration of several years of history for this variable is due to the slower-

moving nature of commercial real estate markets, in contrast with market volatility (measured by 

the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)), stock market prices, and 

corporate bond spreads, as described in those guides below.  The long-lived nature of these 

assets and substantial upfront financial investment involved can loosen the connections between 

their current observed valuations and financial conditions at firms and in broader financial 

markets.  For instance, lending practices adopted in a period of declining prices, such as 2023 

Page 124 of 294 

 
and 2024, can cloud immediate price signals.  Additionally, the complexity of these connections 

and the breadth of property types make it difficult to track developments in the commercial real 

estate sector with a single quantitative indicator or a very limited set of indicators that would 

constitute a basis for the commercial real estate guidance.  Therefore, the proposed guide 

establishes a range of price decline values that determine the magnitude of the price decline to 

the trough, as well as its characteristics. 

The proposed calibration of the range of decline (30 to 45 percent) to the trough for the 

commercial real estate price index is determined to account for commercial real estate price 

behavior in severe post-war U.S. recessions and to allow for increases in severity after economic 

expansions, in line with the principles outlined in the policy statement as well as those discussed 

earlier in this section.  First, the range is centered around the value observed during the 2007–

2009 financial crisis, when commercial real estate prices dropped about 39 percent from the peak 

in 2007Q3 to the trough in 2009Q4 (Table 10).  Second, the extent of commercial real estate 

price upswings provides a guide for their subsequent unwinding and another target for the range.  

As mentioned in the Board’s policy statement, cyclical vulnerabilities rise during more robust 

expansions.  Looking back at the most recent commercial real estate cycle upswing in 2013–

2024, the median four-year commercial real estate price growth rate in this period is about 30 

percent, which the Board uses to calibrate the lower part of the range.  Setting a floor for the 

decline in commercial real estate prices of 30 percent recognizes the fact that, not only do 

cyclical systemic risks build up at financial intermediaries during robust expansions, but also a 

minimum level of risk exists even in an already stressed environment.  Separately, the Board 

opts for 45 percent as the higher end of the range, as a similar value (43 percent, as measured by 

the four-year growth rate of the commercial real estate price index between 2011Q3 to 2015Q3) 

Page 125 of 294 

 
was observed in the 2013–2024 commercial real estate cycle.  The upper end of this range is also 

set to be larger than the 39 percent decrease experienced during the 2007–2009 financial crisis to 

allow for scenarios that feature commercial real estate price declines that are larger than what 

have been seen historically.  Adequate severity requires a guide to be able to go somewhat 

beyond historical experiences when initial conditions warrant.  Furthermore, certain sectors 

within the commercial real estate market have already experienced larger declines than 39 

percent in the post-COVID-19 period, further justifying a range of potential declines that can 

address risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial conditions as they 

arise.

In its formulation of the annual scenarios, the Board could consider the overall level of 

cyclical systemic risk or various indicators related to commercial real estate markets to 

determine the appropriate decline in commercial real estate prices in the scenario.  As discussed 

in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the Board expects to calibrate the decline in 

commercial real estate prices based on its views of the status of cyclical systemic risk.  

Specifically, the Board would be more likely to set the commercial real estate price trough value 

154 Source: Commercial Real Estate Price Index, Z.1 Release (Financial Accounts of the United States), Federal 
Reserve Board (series FL075035503.Q divided by 1000).

at the higher end of the range if the Board expects that cyclical systemic risks are high (as it 

would be after a sustained long expansion), and alternatively would be more likely to set the 

trough value to the lower end of the range if cyclical systemic risks are low (as it would be in the 

earlier stages of a recovery), provided doing so remained consistent with the goal of ensuring 

that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe economic and financial conditions.  This 

may result in a scenario that is more intense than normal if the Board expects that cyclical 

systemic risks were increasing in a period of sustained robust expansion.  

Conversely, it would also allow the Board to specify a scenario that is less intense than 

normal in an environment where systemic risks appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of 

an expansion.  This choice would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to remaining 

stress, thereby exacerbating the initial adverse shock, and it would be particularly appropriate if 

the Board judges that firms are already taking steps to reduce their risk—for instance, by 

potentially restricting lending to otherwise qualified borrowers.  Factors such as whether 

underlying commercial real estate market conditions have started to normalize and higher-than-

usual credit losses stemming from previous commercial real estate price declines were either 

already realized—or are in the process of being realized—and thus removed from firms’ balance 

sheets would contribute to the assessment of cyclical systemic risks.155 

Figure 1 illustrates how the proposed guide (range between solid lines) performs 

compared to past scenarios (shown as dots).  As seen in this figure, the proposed guide fully 

brackets the declines featured in previous scenarios.  Thus, the proposed guide is likely to result 

in similar stress test severity as before this revision to the policy statement.   

155 A commercial real estate market normalization could occur when lending standards stop tightening, commercial 
real estate price levels stabilize, and the capitalization rate moves toward the middle of its historical range or higher.  
Evidence that credit losses are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases or loan-loss 
provisions in excess of gross charge-offs.

Scenarios (in percent)156 

Alternative Trough Guide Option 

The Board considered an alternative trough option in which commercial real estate prices 

fall 35 percent from the jump-off value, or reversal of prior 4 years of price increases up to 45 

percent, whichever results in a larger decline.  The calibration of the alternative guide relies on 

the similar observations shown in Table 10 and used for the calibration of the proposed guide.  

Specifically, the alternative guide caps the decline in the commercial real estate prices to a range 

between 35 and 45 percent.  However, to determine the specific decline in this range, in contrast 

to the proposed guide which considers a variety of commercial real estate-market indicators and 

allows for weighing them against each other, this alternative focuses on only one dimension of 

156 Z.1 Release (Financial Accounts of the United States), Federal Reserve Board; Federal Reserve staff estimates. 

Page 128 of 294 

 
 
 
 
potential risks in the commercial real estate market—price pressures accumulated over the 

previous 4 years—and formalizes the decline to the trough based on this indicator.  

The alternative guide stipulates that commercial real estate prices will decline to the 

trough from the jump-off value by 35 percent or by an amount needed to offset the four-year 

commercial real estate price growth preceding the jump-off quarter.  Hence, the alternative 

minimum decline could be somewhat more severe compared to the proposed guide.  That said, 

the decline is capped at 45 percent to constrain the trough calibration within historically plausible 

bounds.  The choice of four years (rather than, for example, the one-year look back used in the 

equity price guide) to span the relevant accumulation period of price pressures for this guide 

stems from a slower-moving nature of the commercial real estate cycle, in contrast to faster 

moving variables (like VIX or stock prices).  At the same time, choosing a longer look-back time 

period, such as five years, for example, would often produce commercial real estate growth rates 

above 45 percent, thus triggering the 45 percent maximum threshold of the guide too frequently 

and resulting in excessive scenario severity relative to historically observed events, particularly 

at the beginning of market corrections.157 

The commercial real estate price troughs set in past annual stress test scenarios and the 

prescription of the alternative guide could be noticeably different.  In the data, previous 

commercial real estate price changes in annual stress test scenarios, the key factor in determining 

the prescription for the alternative guide, are not always highly correlated with other commercial 

real estate indicators that the Board would have used to gauge the extent of salient risks at the 

time.  

157 In the 2014–2024 period, for example, 5-year growth rates above 45 percent occur in 2014Q4, 2015Q1, 2016Q3, 
2016Q4, 2017Q1. 

Page 129 of 294 

 
 
For instance, from 2021–2023 (post-COVID-19 pandemic) the alternative guide would 

prescribe troughs at 35 percent below jump-off values, while the proposed guide would prescribe 

troughs similar to those of past scenarios, around 40 percent below jump-off.  The alternative 

guide thus would not have accounted for the unusually small number of commercial real estate 

sales that occurred during that period and the upward biases in transaction-based commercial real 

estate price indices created by the strategic behavior of owners, lenders, and buyers in those 

conditions.158  Once commercial real estate prices had declined considerably by 2024 and 

transaction volumes increased, the shallower trough calibration for this alternative guide aligns 

with the Board’s choice for the severely adverse scenario.159  This example illustrates that 

focusing on only one quantitative indicator (four-year commercial real estate price growth) may 

be too narrow to determine an adequate severity for the magnitude of decline from the start of 

the stress test scenario to its trough (i.e., start-to-trough decline) for this variable.   

Therefore, a guide that weighs a broader range of indicators and how conditions differ by 

property type could provide a fuller, more adequate framework for the Board to choose an 

appropriate level of stress for commercial real estate exposures in future stress test scenarios.  

Consequently, the Board would consider the overall level of cyclical systemic risk, which is 

informed by a range of indicators related to commercial real estate markets, in its formulation of 

the annual scenarios as discussed in this section.

Although the proposed and the alternative guides are both discussed, and the Board views 

the alternative guide as reasonable, it may be insufficient to capture the complexity of the 

commercial real estate market relative to the proposed guide.  In addition, the implementation of 

the alternative guide for commercial real estate would be complicated by the lack of a real-time 

commercial real estate price indicator.  Typically, the data are available with a 4-month lag, 

which means that the final quarter or two of data required to compute the value of the guide 

would be based on a projection rather than reported data.  The purpose of the alternative guide 

discussion is to invite comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to 

transparently lay out the Board’s present arguments for choosing the proposed guide. 

b. 

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Trough Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the trough and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The Board considers the 

dynamics of commercial real estate prices using the official NBER recession dates augmented by 

one year prior to the beginning of the recession and one year after the end of the recession to 

compute summary statistics for validating the timing of the trough for commercial real estate 

prices in this guide.  The Board considers such additional data points because of the slow-

moving nature of the commercial real estate cycles, as referenced earlier in this section, in 

comparison with the fast-moving and forward-looking behavior of equity prices, corporate bond 

spreads, and VIX, for which the moves following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy during the 

2007–2009 financial crisis are most consistent with the scenario narrative adopted in this 

proposed policy statement. 

Page 131 of 294 

 
The guide stipulates that the trough level in the scenario would be reached in quarters 8 to 

10.  This range is consistent with the slower-moving nature of commercial real estate price 

cycles, the practice in previous severely adverse scenarios, and the behavior in previous periods 

of financial stress or recession.  In the stress episode surrounding the 2007–2009 financial crisis, 

the commercial real estate price trough was in quarter 9 (Table 10).  The usual process of slow 

adjustment of commercial real estate prices and the ambiguity in the measurement of those prices 

described earlier in this section motivates the Board to reserve a range in which the adjustment 

occurs.  Keeping the magnitude of the trough constant, a more delayed trough timing generally 

results in less severity of the overall path, as a less abrupt worsening in conditions and credit 

quality gives firms more time to adjust to the shock.  Thus, a range in the timing (quarter 8 to 10) 

is an additional lever (together with the trough magnitude range) to avoiding the addition of 

sources of procyclicality in the stress test.  The Board would likely consider a delayed timing of 

the trough when the cyclical vulnerabilities are lower, and an earlier trough timing when the 

Board deems it appropriate to increase scenario severity, as described in this section in relation to 

the choice of price decline. 

Trajectory to Trough Value 

To reach the trough value, the guide prescribes a smooth roughly-linear transition from 

the jump-off point to the trough.  This prescription is consistent with the linear models often used 

in the statistical modeling of macroeconomic series.160  Commercial real estate prices are slower-

moving, even in crisis times, so there is less evidence of the frontloading seen in faster-moving 

variables such as the VIX or BBB spreads.  Moreover, the breadth of property types and lags in 

160 See, e.g., M. Marcellino, J. Stock, & M. Watson, A Comparison of Direct and Iterated Multistep AR Methods for 
Forecasting Macroeconomic Time Series, 135 J. OF ECONOMETRICS 449–526 (2006) (discussing the popular linear 
time series models used for forecasting macroeconomic time series).

real-time data availability contribute to the difficulty of tracking the developments in this sector.  

As discussed above, transactions-based prices may have biases based on the strategic behavior of 

the parties involved.  Given these circumstances, considering more complicated trajectories may 

inject unnecessary volatility into the exercise, counter to the principles laid out on effective stress 

testing in Quarles (2019).161 

The trajectories prescribed in previous scenarios are consistent with the proposed 

guidance that commercial real estate price declines are not frontloaded.  The two exceptions are 

for the scenarios during 2017 and 2018, where the largest declines occur in the second quarter of 

the scenario.  In these years’ scenarios, to test the resilience of the banking system to strong 

economic conditions and commercial real estate price increases in prior years, the Board chose 

scenarios which called for deeper and earlier declines in commercial real estate prices than 

considered in prior years’ stress test scenarios.  Notwithstanding these exceptions, the smoother 

decline specified by the proposed guide is more in line with historical behavior of the series and 

has the benefit of reducing volatility. 

Equity Prices 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including equity prices 

proxied by the U.S. Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index (DWCF).162  This index includes about 

3,700 stocks trading on U.S. exchanges that account for 95 percent of the total market 

capitalization.

value via Bloomberg Finance L.P.; this index encompasses a wider universe of stocks than the S&P 500 Composite. 

Page 133 of 294 

 
 
Along with commercial real estate prices, housing prices, and the VIX, equity prices are 

an essential gauge for asset prices that affect the U.S. economy and the financial conditions of 

financial and nonfinancial firms.  Equity prices are generally recognized as a leading indicator of 

future economic conditions broadly, including economic growth and inflation.163  Therefore, 

testing the ability of a firm to withstand a steep decline in equity prices helps ensure that these 

firms are properly capitalized to withstand severe economic and financial conditions. 

In the supervisory stress test scenarios, equity prices are converted to quarterly frequency 

using the quarter-end value.  The Board’s use of this aggregation method in the severely adverse 

scenario, rather than average or maximum value in the quarter used for other variables, is a 

deliberate choice that reflects how equity prices might impact the balance sheets of financial 

institutions.  Quarter-end values provide a clear, specific point-in-time snapshot of market 

conditions, which is crucial for assessing firms’ balance sheets and market risk exposures.  For 

trading books and fair-value estimates for assets that firms hold, quarter-end prices provide the 

most up-to-date mark-to-market valuation, which is critical for stress testing.  Equity markets are 

typically more liquid than debt markets or markets for real estate, which means the most recent 

prices are less likely to be affected by technical factors instead of economic fundamentals and 

expectations about future conditions than in bonds or property markets.  Using quarter-end 

values also makes it easier to compare stress scenarios with historical data, which is often 

reported on a quarter-end basis.  Finally, many equity options expire at the end of quarters, 

making quarter-end prices particularly relevant for assessing option-related risks. 

163 In the academic literature, stock prices are well-known to be fast-moving or forward-looking variables that react 
to shocks quickly.  One prominent example is the study by B. Bernanke, J. Boivin, & P. Eliasz, Measuring the 
Effects of Monetary Policy: a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) Approach, 120 Q. J. OF ECON. 
387-422 (2005) (classifying stock market prices as fast-moving variables that respond to shocks on impact).  

Page 134 of 294 

 
 
In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to the 

scenario design principles discussed in the earlier Section IX.F of this Supplementary 

Information.  While doing so, the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of 

procyclicality into the financial system.  In the context of equity prices, these principles are 

applied in calibrating three key aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of the trough 

value, and the trajectory to trough.  This approach helps ensure that the equity price guide aligns 

with the established stress testing literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the 

financial system. 

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Table 11 summarizes all of the 

equity prices guide components.  This is followed by a detailed description of the guide’s trough 

component, including the data- and scenario-based rationale for the calibration of the trough 

component and a discussion of the alternative trough option.  Finally, additional guide 

parameters and the rationale for their calibration are discussed.

Trough Value Component of the Guide 

The proposed guide stipulates that the decline in equity prices from the jump-off value 

(i.e., the value of the equity price index at the end of the quarter immediately preceding the start 

of the scenario) will vary around 50 percent with an additional amount that offsets one half of the 

price growth over the prior year, up to 10 percent.  These declines imply that equity prices would 

fall to a trough level that is between 40 and 60 percent below the jump-off value.  More formally, 

this calibration implies that at the trough of the scenario path, equity prices fall by 

50% + min(10%, |∆(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝)|/2) , 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ∆(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝) ≥ 0

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Trough Value 

�

In line with the scenario design principles for setting the scenario severity, discussed 

earlier in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the rationale behind the choice of the 

neutral value of 50 percent comes from the data, as several recessions in the sample featured a 

decline of this magnitude.  In particular, the equity price declines in the 1973 recession and the 

2001 recession were 46 percent, whereas the decline in the 2007–2009 financial crisis measured 

Page 136 of 294 

 
 
 
48 percent (Table 12).  The equity price decline in the 2007–2009 financial crisis is most 

analogous to the scenario narrative, which starts with a substantial adverse shock to risk appetite 

and uncertainty and leads to a period of market disfunction followed by very high 

unemployment.  Other financial stress episodes have seen maximum equity price declines of less 

than 50 percent, but in those instances the declines were not exacerbated by market dysfunction 

as considered in the scenario narrative. 

The adjustment portion of this guide responds to the possibility that economic or 

financial conditions at the beginning of the annual stress test cycle might warrant a decline in 

equity prices that is smaller or larger than 50 percent.  This flexibility reduces the likelihood that 

the calibration of the trough would unduly amplify rising or falling valuation pressures in equity 

prices over the past year.  When the stock market does well (or poorly) in the prior year, the 

guide stipulates that equity prices fall by more (respectively, less), with the exact amount 

determined by one half of the prior year’s price change.  The use of half instead of, for example, 

full price change results in troughs that are less likely to be unduly severe.  This calibration of 

the guide is based on historical equity market valuations.  However, when recent price moves are 

not consistent with fundamentals or longer-term trends, the Board could deviate from the 

proposed guide and use price growth over a longer horizon.

The choice of 10 percentage points as the upper bound for the absolute value of the year-

to-year variation in this scenario variable, or equivalently the choice of effective bounds 

(between 40 and 60 percent) on the trough decline, is rooted in the data and is similar to changes 

that have been used in past severely adverse scenarios.  The upper end of the range would allow 

the Board to meaningfully increase scenario severity when equity market valuations are likely to 

be high or rising (as they were during the dot-com era) to ensure that firms are resilient to 

outsized losses if valuations return to more normal levels.  The lower end of the range would 

allow the Board to reduce scenario severity if equity valuation pressures recently declined, as 

might be the case following a stock market correction or early in an economic recovery.166  

164  The Board uses the DWCF for the scenarios because this index encompasses a wider universe of stocks 
compared with the S&P 500 Composite. That said, the quantitative differences between the two measures are rather 
small.  For instance, the implied declines in the dotcom episode would be 45.6 percent for both the Dow Jones time 
series and the S&P 500 Composite time series.  Also, the overall correlation of the one-year growth rate computed 
for both time series on their common sample (1988Q1–2024Q4) is 0.99.  Therefore, to cover a larger sample of 
historical episodes, the Board uses the S&P 500 Composite time series to compute statistics in columns (1) and (2) 
and uses the DWCF to compute statistics in column (3).

166 Assessing equity market valuations requires some judgment as to the indicators that are used. Two commonly 
referenced indicators are the equity price to expected earnings ratio and the equity risk premium, which is the 
estimated expected return on equities minus the 10-year Treasury yield.  These measures rely on projections of 
future earnings and other economic indicators that require additional judgments.  Therefore, the Board has chosen to 
increase transparency and predictability by specifying this guide based on directly observable equity price changes 

Page 138 of 294 

 
 
 
 
Setting a floor for the decline in equity prices of 40 percent recognizes the fact that, not only do 

cyclical systemic risks build up at financial intermediaries during robust expansions, but a 

minimum level of risk exists even in an already stressed environment. 

Figure 2 illustrates how the proposed guide performs relative to the 2014–2025 stress test 

cycles, comparing the guide-implied decline with those of past stress test scenarios and realized 

changes in equity prices.  Overall, the troughs implied by the proposed guide (solid line) are 

similar to past scenario troughs.  However, deviations between the proposed guide and past 

scenarios have been distributed across lower or higher severity, implying that the proposed guide 

and the previous more-judgmental process can provide similar average severity across multiple 

years of stress tests.  Indeed, the decline in equity prices in past stress test scenarios during 2014-

2025 averages 52 percent, whereas the proposed guide’s prescription of the declines for the same 

period averages 55 percent.  The slightly higher average decline is consistent with the principle 

of adequate severity discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information. 

and will typically use the guide rather than relying on judgmental assessments of other indicators of underlying 
valuation pressures.

Alternative Trough Guide Option 

The Board considered an alternative in which the trough would be a 50 percent decline 

from the jump-off value in equity prices unconditional on the previous year’s price change and 

jump-off conditions.  The 50 percent value is chosen based on the same reasons as the midpoint 

of the proposed guide.  Although this alternative option is fully transparent and predictable, it has 

several weaknesses. 

On average, the proposed guide would prescribe troughs that would have been somewhat 

lower than the alternative if it had been operational over the past 12 years: 55 percent for the 

proposed guide on average vs 50 percent for the alternative.  However, although a 50 percent 

167 Bloomberg Finance L.P. (ticker: “DWCF”) and Federal Reserve staff estimates.  

Page 140 of 294 

 
 
 
 
decline matches the judgmental average, it means that the test would be more severe each year 

than the decline observed during the 2007–2009 financial crisis.   

Furthermore, as the alternative guide is not sensitive to the jump-off conditions, the 

resulting troughs could be either excessive or insufficient in severity, thus exacerbating 

procyclicality in ways the proposed guide does not.  This weakness would be particularly 

detrimental to the credibility of the stress test during long bull markets (as the United States has 

experienced during the stress testing era) or periods of protracted decline in equity prices as the 

stress test would be serially under- or over-stating the likely risks. 

The Board also considered a wider range in the proposed guide.  An upper bound of 15 

percentage points for the variable change relative to the midpoint of 50 percent would imply a 

much wider range of 35 to 65 percent declines at the trough.  A 65 percent decline has not been 

observed in the post-war US data, whereas a 35 percent equity price decline could be 

insufficiently severe to maintain credibility of the test at times of heightened uncertainty.  An 

upper bound of 5 percentage points for the variable change from the midpoint would cover the 

relevant historical benchmarks but would provide a narrow range: between 45 and 55 percent 

decline at the trough.  This choice would substantially limit the Board’s ability to match the 

severity of the equity price decline with the recent performance in equity markets so might 

inadvertently add to procyclical forces in financial markets.  A choice of 10 percentage points as 

the upper bound on the change relative to the 50 percent midpoint strikes a balance between an 

overly narrow and an overly wide adjustment window. 

Although the proposed and the alternative guides are both discussed, and the Board views 

the alternative guide as reasonable, the alternative guide’s inability to respond to recent changes 

in equity valuations would be a significant limitation compared with the proposed guide.  The 

Page 141 of 294 

 
purpose of the alternative guide discussion is to invite comment on a reasonable alternative 

considered by the Board and to transparently lay out the Board’s present arguments for choosing 

the proposed guide. 

b. 

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Trough Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the trough and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The guide stipulates that the 

trough level in the scenario would be reached in quarter 3 or quarter 4, which is consistent with 

historical observations (Table 12).  For instance, in the stress episode surrounding the 2007–2009 

financial crisis, the trough for equity markets occurred three quarters after the bankruptcy of 

Lehman Brothers in 2008Q3.168  That timing also accords with the scenario narrative, in which a 

sudden and significant increase in uncertainty and rapid deterioration in risk appetite leads to a 

spike in financial market volatility and a sharp decline in U.S. financial assets during the first 

quarter of the scenario. 

Trajectory to Trough Value 

To reach the trough value, the guide prescribes that between 60 and 70 percent of the 

decline occurs in the first quarter of the scenario, 10 to 20 percent of the decline occurs in the 

second quarter, with the remaining decline being realized about equally in the remaining 

quarter(s) to trough.  This trajectory is consistent with the scenario narrative in which a severe 

168 Note that in the case of fast-moving variables (such as equity prices or the VIX), the Board times the onset of the 
stress period during the 2007–2009 financial crisis based on the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy rather than the NBER 
recession timing. 

Page 142 of 294 

 
 
recession is triggered by a large financial shock in the first quarter followed by a return to normal 

market functioning in subsequent quarters.   

These expected trajectory benchmarks reduce the variation in trajectories relative to 

previous scenarios: across past severely adverse scenarios, the median first quarter decline in 

equity prices was 68.3 percent of the total decline, so a range between 60 and 70 percent is in 

line with the midpoint of past scenario choices.  Also, across past severely adverse scenarios, the 

median second quarter decline in equity prices was 18.4 percent of the total decline, which is 

also within the range of 10 to 20 percent specified in this guide.  Such a frontloaded decline is 

also consistent with the status of equity prices in the index of leading economic indicators and 

the empirical evidence from periods of equity market weakness.169  Across episodes of stock 

market distress, the average share of the decline realized in the two quarters preceding the trough 

amounts to 63 percent, with one episode measuring a much higher 88 percent in one quarter (in 

1962) and most measuring 50 percent or more for these two quarters (for example, 52 percent in 

the 2007–2009 financial crisis).170  

In specifying a range for the timing of the trough and the proportion of declines in each 

quarter along the trajectory to the trough the Board maintains the option to create more or less 

severe scenarios if it wishes to avoid adding to existing procyclical factors or for another reason.  

An earlier trough with higher frontloading of the declines generally would be more severe.  The 

Board could consider an earlier trough timing or higher frontloading when economic and 

financial market conditions are buoyant, such as when equity prices have increased by more than 

169 In the academic literature, stock prices are well-known to be fast-moving or forward-looking variables that react 
to shocks fast.  See infra note 163. 

170 The episodes of stock market distress include the recessions of 1969, 1973, 2001, the 2007–2009 financial crisis 
as well as the stock market decline in 1962. 

Page 143 of 294 

 
 
the maximum 10 percent adjustment to the trough level.  A delayed trough timing and lower 

frontloading generally would decrease the scenario severity.  The Board could consider delayed 

timing of the trough or smaller frontloading when equity prices at jump-off are depressed but 

have been increasing, or are projected to increase, and firms have de-risked and begun to 

recognize related losses. 

VIX 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including the VIX, that 

is, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s CBOE Volatility Index.  The VIX is an index 

measuring implied volatility based on a portfolio of options of the Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 

500).171  The VIX is calculated and distributed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange.172   

The VIX is often referred to as the “fear index” because it measures the market’s 

expectation of future volatility.  Furthermore, equity market volatility has been often used as an 

indicator of the price of risk, along with the spreads, which can depress economic activity when 

elevated.173  

In the supervisory stress test models that use the macroeconomic scenario, the VIX can 

act as an indicator of stress for a wide range of important assets and income streams even if those 

business lines are not specifically linked to the VIX index.  By incorporating the VIX into 

scenarios, stress tests help ensure that firms are prepared for a wide range of market conditions,

exchanges in the United States.

173 The role of equity market volatility as an indicator of the price of risk (along with the spreads) is discussed in T. 
Adrian, N. Boyarchenko, & D. Giannone, Vulnerable Growth, 109 AM. ECON. REV. 1263–89 (2019).  Relatedly, the 
National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago constructs a risk 
subcomponent that is based on co-movement between volatility measures and spreads.  See S. Brave & A. Butters,

CENTRAL BANKING 191–239 (2012) 

Page 144 of 294 

 
 
including periods of extreme volatility and uncertainty and any associated economic 

downturn.174  This helps maintain the overall stability and resilience of the financial system. 

In the supervisory stress test scenarios, the VIX is converted to quarterly frequency using 

the maximum close-of-day value in any quarter and expressed in percent.  The Board’s use of 

this aggregation method in the scenarios, rather than average or quarter-end values as used for 

other variables, is a deliberate choice to have at least one scenario variable that reflects the 

unique nature of market volatility and its impact on financial institutions.  This approach ensures 

firms are tested against the most extreme, potentially destabilizing market conditions, even if 

short-lived.  Short-term and sharp increases in the VIX can reflect markets’ initial response to 

changes in risk appetite or the economic outlook that then have longer-lasting adverse effects on 

the broader economy, such as reduced employment.175  Moreover, the use of the maximum 

close-of-day values captures the non-linear effects of volatility spikes on financial instruments, 

risk models, and liquidity, while also testing firms’ ability to handle rapid market movements, 

margin calls, and behavioral factors during peak stress. 

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to scenario 

design principles discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While doing so, 

the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the financial 

system.  In the context of the VIX, these principles are applied in calibrating three key aspects of 

the guide: the peak value, the timing of the peak value, and the trajectory to peak.  This approach

potential systemic risks for the financial system. 

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Error! Reference source not

guide description of the peak component.  A data- and scenario-based rationale for the 

calibration of the peak component follows in the next subsection.  Next is a discussion of an 

alternative peak option, comparing the implementation and caveats to the proposed guide option.

Peak Value Component of the Proposed Guide 

The VIX will increase to a level between 65 percent and 75 percent or by at least 10 

percentage points from the jump-off value, whichever results in a higher level.176  

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Peak Value 

In line with the scenario design principles for setting the scenario severity, discussed in 

Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the VIX guide calibrates the minimum level to 

be between 65 percent and 75 percent.  This choice is consistent with the historical observations 

during periods of stress (Table 14).  In particular, the proposed range for the peak value of the 

176 Theoretically, there is no upper bound on the VIX; i.e., it is not constrained by 100 percent (or any other ceiling 
value).  However, a value surpassing 100 percent would require extraordinary levels of daily market volatility and 
has never been observed in the historical sample, spanning 1990Q1–2025Q1. 

Page 146 of 294 

 
  
 
guide is calibrated based mainly on the range of VIX realizations across four recent recessions or 

episodes of financial stress.  The minimum value of 65 also reflects a judgment that the stress 

test always must be consistent with the goal of promoting financial stability, which means that 

markets and the public must continue to view the stress test as sufficiently severe to maintain 

confidence, especially during periods of high uncertainty and volatility.177  Thus, the lower end 

of the range for the guide is chosen to be modestly above the average VIX peak of 61 percent 

(first column).  Moreover, setting a floor for the increase in the VIX of 65 percent recognizes the 

fact that, not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial intermediaries during robust 

expansions, but a minimum level of risk exists even in an already stressed environment.  The 

higher end of the range is close to the maximum value across those periods, 83 percent, which 

was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic (third column).

The minimum increment of 10 percentage points would only be relevant if the jump-off 

occurred during a period of already-high volatility (for example, in the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis, when the peak was 81 percent, or in the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was 83 percent).  In 

such an instance, the guide allows for the possibility that conditions could worsen further, given 

the other aspects of the severely adverse scenario, such as the increase in unemployment and 

decline in house prices from the baseline.  This assumption ensures that the VIX scenario peak is 

adequately severe.  Limiting the increase to 10 percentage points ensures, however, that the peak 

does not deviate too far from historically observed levels and become unduly contractionary.  

Figure 3 plots historical VIX data, past scenario peaks, and this guide (solid lines).  On 

average across the past stress test scenarios (2014-2025), the VIX has been approximately 30 

percent at the jump-off quarter, i.e., the data observation serving as a starting point for the 

scenario.  The implied increase from the initial condition to the peak can be quite large—in such 

instances where the VIX is around 30 percent at the jump-off quarter, the increase to the peak 

value would be between 35-45 percentage points.  Such rapid increases in the VIX are consistent 

with what occurred during the four stress episodes considered in this calibration.  On average 

across those episodes, which start in 1990Q1 when data for the VIX became available, the VIX 

increases by approximately 39 percentage points from the onset of a stress event, which is one 

quarter before the start of the NBER recession date, to its peak, a value within the range implied 

by the guide (see Table 14, first column).

Figure 3:  Implied Range of the VIX, Peak Values in Past Scenarios, and Historical Data on the 
VIX (in percent)179 

Figure 3 illustrates the comparison of the guide-implied peak range of the VIX 

(delineated by the solid lines) against the peaks in past stress test scenarios (shown as dots), 

accompanied by the respective jump-off points from the data (dashed line).  Two key results 

emerge.  First, past peaks chosen by the Board in previous severely adverse scenarios are mostly 

within the bounds that would have been stipulated by the VIX guide.  In the two instances where 

the Board would have been more constrained, one episode was higher than the upper bound and 

the other lower than the lower bound.  Thus, the guide is likely to result, on average, in similar 

stress test severity as before this revision to the policy statement while having the benefit of each 

individual year’s scenario being more transparent and predictable.  Second, the flexibility in the 

proposed guide to have a minimum increase of 10 percentage points provides adequate severity 

during stressful times, even beyond the upper end of the range for typical jump-off quarters.  For 

instance, in 2020Q1, when the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded and the VIX jumped, reaching the 

179 Sources: Chicago Board Options Exchange via Bloomberg Finance L.P. and Federal Reserve staff estimates. 

Page 149 of 294 

 
 
 
historical maximum of the VIX, the prescribed peak would have been higher than 75 percent.  

Given the severity of the underlying conditions in 2020Q1, the peak would be determined by the 

jump-off point and the 10-percentage-point increment, resulting in a peak of 93 percent. 

In its formulation of the annual scenarios, the Board’s considerations would include the 

overall level of cyclical systemic risk, the current level of the VIX as a contemporaneous 

indicator of uncertainty and financial stress, and the performance of equity prices within the past 

12 months as a forward-looking indicator of economic and financing conditions to determine the 

appropriate increase in the VIX in the scenario.  As discussed in Section IX.F of this 

Supplementary Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increment in the VIX based on its 

views of the status of cyclical systemic risk.  Specifically, the Board would be more likely to set 

the VIX peak value at the higher end of the range if the Board expects that cyclical systemic 

risks are high (as it would be after a sustained long expansion), and alternatively would be more 

likely to set the peak value to the lower end of the range if cyclical systemic risks are low (as it 

would be in the earlier stages of a recovery), provided doing so remained consistent with the goal 

of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe economic and financial 

conditions.  This may result in a scenario that is more intense than normal if the Board expects 

that cyclical systemic risks were to be increasing in a period of sustained robust expansion.  

Conversely, it would also allow the Board to specify a scenario that is less intense than normal in 

an environment where systemic risks appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of a recovery.  

This choice would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to remaining stress, thereby 

exacerbating the initial adverse shock.  The lower end of the increase range could also be 

appropriate when underlying market uncertainty and financial stress start to recede and higher-

than-usual credit losses stemming from previously elevated vulnerabilities were either already 

Page 150 of 294 

 
realized—or are in the process of being realized—and thus removed from firms’ balance 

sheets.180  

Alternative Peak Guide Option 

The Board considered an alternative in which the VIX would increase to 75 percent or by 

at least 10 percentage points from the jump-off value, whichever results in a higher level.  In this 

alternative peak option, the VIX would be set at a level of 75 percent in typical future scenarios.  

This prescriptive implementation would follow the principle of conservatism by always moving 

the VIX close to its historical maximum.  It would also have the benefit of increasing the 

predictability of the guide.  However, when the VIX at the jump-off value is elevated but has 

been declining or is projected to decline and firm balance sheets are recovering, this alternative 

would remove the Board’s discretion to choose a lower peak for the VIX.  A lower but still 

constant value for the VIX guide in a typical scenario, for instance with a lower bound of 65 

percent (corresponding to the average value across past scenarios) might not provide sufficient 

resilience in normal times, as the actual peaks of the VIX in the 2007–2009 financial crisis and 

during the COVID-19 pandemic exceeded 80 percent.  Although a lower anchor could be 

coupled with a higher minimum increment value—for example, 20 percentage points—such a 

large increment in already stressful times removes the Board’s discretion to choose a less severe 

VIX peak.  Although the proposed and alternative guides are discussed, and the Board views a 

more restrictive alternative guide as potentially reasonable, the Board believes the alternative 

guide is inferior to the proposed guide, given the variation in peak levels of the VIX the Board 

has found appropriate in past stress test scenarios.  Nonetheless, the purpose of the alternative 

180 Evidence of market uncertainty and financial stress receding could include strong stock market performance or 
positive economic news related to GDP, unemployment or nonfarm payroll.  Evidence that credit losses are being 
realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases or loan-loss provisions in excess of gross charge-
offs.

guide discussion is to invite comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to 

transparently lay out the Board’s present arguments for choosing the proposed guide.  

b. 

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Peak Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the peak and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The guide stipulates that the 

peak level in the scenario would be reached in quarter 2, which is consistent with past severely 

adverse scenarios and historical observations.  The peak was reached in quarter 2 in both the 

2007–2009 financial crisis and in the COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 14).181  Averaging across 

all four financial stress episodes used to calibrate the guide yields a peak in quarter 3.  As 

historical maximum values of the VIX were reached in the 2007–2009 financial crisis and during 

the COVID-19 pandemic, and the scenario narrative specifies that the event is triggered by a 

financial crisis similar to events in the fall of 2008, the Board considers the peak timing in 

quarter 2 more appropriate for both the proposed and the alternative guide.   

Trajectory to Peak Value 

To reach the peak value, the guide prescribes that the highest share, 60 to 80 percent, of 

the VIX increase occurs in the first quarter of the scenario.  Such frontloading of the increase is 

broadly consistent with empirical evidence and with the behavior of the other fast-moving 

181 The Board determined that the timing of the start of the stress period should sometimes differ from the start date 
of the recession determined by the NBER.  For potentially fast-moving variables (such as the VIX), the Board times 
the onset of the stress period during the 2007–2009 financial crisis based on the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy on 
September 15, 2008.  This event is widely considered to be the most significant of the events that roiled financial 
markets during the 2007–2009 financial crisis episode.  As stress test data operate at quarterly frequency, the 
Board’s timing of this event for determining the subsequent timing of the peak VIX is in 2008Q3.  The focus on the 
Lehman Brothers bankruptcy as the triggering event is more consistent with the stress test scenario narrative in 
which a financial shock sets the stress test scenario dynamics in motion than the NBER recession date. 

Page 152 of 294 

 
 
variables (such as equity prices) in the scenario.  Additionally, the academic literature considers 

the VIX (and other measures of uncertainty) a contemporaneous stress indicator that can respond 

to shocks on impact and stresses the importance of contemporaneous feedback between 

uncertainty and financial conditions.182  For instance, 100 percent of the increase in the VIX 

occurred in the first quarter of the 1990Q3–1991Q1 recession.  During the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis, nearly 40 percent of the increase in the VIX occurred in the first quarter.183  In specifying 

a target for the proportion of increase to be realized in the first quarter, the Board would follow 

the same approach that it would use to assess appropriate severity for the peak value.  In 

particular, during economic booms, the Board might formulate a scenario with greater 

frontloading of the VIX increases, as the scenarios with greater frontloading would contribute to 

higher severity.  In the case of an economy that is characterized by moderate or slowing 

economic growth, the Board would likely stipulate the middle of the range of the VIX increases.  

Whereas in economic downturns or at the beginning of a recovery, the Board would expect to 

formulate a scenario with less frontloading of the VIX increases. 

5-Year Treasury Yield 

The stress test scenario sets out trajectories for several variables, including the 5-year 

Treasury yield, which is measured using the quarterly average of the yield on 5-year U.S. 

Treasury notes.184  

182 The importance of contemporaneous feedback between uncertainty and financial conditions is discussed, for 
example, in S. Gilchrist, J. Sim, & E. Zakrajsek, Uncertainty, Financial Frictions, and Investment Dynamics, NBER 
Working Paper (2014), and D. Caldara et al., The Macroeconomic Impact of Financial and Uncertainty Shocks, 88

Because banks generally engage in maturity transformation by borrowing short-term (i.e., 

deposits) to fund longer-term assets, fluctuations in interest rates can affect their financial health 

in various ways.185  The 5-year Treasury yield is an important benchmark rate for credit markets 

and is, thus, directly related to the profitability of banks’ investments in loans and securities as 

well as their trading activities.  For example, a decline in longer-term Treasury yields that 

exceeds the decline in short-term yields (known as a flattening of the yield curve) tends to 

compress firms’ net interest margins and can therefore reduce their profitability.  At the same 

time, the decline in such yields tends to increase the market value of firms’ investments in long-

term fixed-rate bonds, some which is reflected in various measures of capital at firms.186  

Incorporating the 5-year Treasury yield into the supervisory stress test helps to ensure that firms 

are prepared for a wide range of market conditions, including periods with a sudden decline in a 

credit market benchmark rate.  This helps maintain the overall stability and resilience of the 

financial system. 

The Board uses a quarterly average of the 5-year Treasury yield in the stress test 

scenarios.  Quarterly averages smooth out excessive (and potentially irrelevant) volatility that is 

present at daily or even monthly frequencies.  Using quarterly averages strikes a balance between 

being sensitive enough to capture market trends and stable enough to avoid overreaction to 

market noise.  Relatedly, the 5-year yield reflects long-term expectations of overall economic 

conditions.  Therefore, removing short-term volatility from this measure via quarterly averaging 

is likely to, more-often-than-not, result in a better representation of macroeconomic conditions.

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to scenario 

design principles discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While doing so, 

the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the financial 

system.  In the context of the 5-year yield, these principles are applied in calibrating three key 

aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of the trough value, and the trajectory to trough.  

This approach ensures that the 5-year yield guide aligns with the established stress testing 

literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the financial system. 

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Table 15 presents an overview of 

the 5-year Treasury yield guide components, followed by the guide description of the trough 

component.  The next subsection provides the data- and scenario-based rationale for the 

calibration of the trough component.  A discussion of an alternative trough option follows in the 

next subsection, comparing the implementation and caveats to the proposed guide option.  

Finally, additional guide parameters (trough value timing and trajectory to the trough) and the 

rationale for their calibration are discussed.

The largest share of the decline is realized in Quarter 1. The approximate 
share is given by the following formula:

Thereafter, the yield declines to its trough level at smoothly decreasing 
percent reductions.

a. 

Trough Value Component of the Proposed Guide  

Under the proposed guide, the 5-year Treasury yield decreases from its starting value by 

1.5 to 3.5 percentage points.  The Board expects to determine the size of the scenario’s decline 

based on relevant banking, macroeconomic, or other conditions in the economy or financial 

markets.187  Additionally, the size of the decline will likely be informed by (a) the behavior of 

short-term interest rates in the macroeconomic model for stress testing that the Board has 

developed specifically to aid in communicating the stress test scenario to the public,188 (b) 

estimates of the likely term premiums in a period of economic weakness consistent with the 

scenario narrative, and (c) risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial 

conditions.189  However, the guide restricts the 5-year Treasury yield from falling below a lower 

bound of 0.3 percent or a decline of 0.3 percentage points from the jump-off level, whichever is 

lower.  

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Proposed Trough Value 

In the recession approach chosen by the Board, risk-free long-term interest rates fall 

because reduced economic activity and inflation result in an easing of monetary policy.  As noted 

above, declining interest rates can have both positive and negative implications for firms’ capital 

levels, depending on the firm’s business model and the specific composition of its assets and 

liabilities at the start of the stress test.   

187 Depending on the level of short-term interest rates, in some scenarios, the short-term rate could reach its trough 
slower than the 5-year and 10-year yields.  In those cases, the scenario would include the inversion of the yield 
curve in the first few scenario quarters.  Such behavior is in line with past scenarios as well as behavior of interest 
rates preceding past stress episodes, like the 2001Q1–2001Q4 recession, the 2007–2009 financial crisis and the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

188 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.  

189 In the Board’s macroeconomic model for the stress test, the path of the 5-year Treasury yield is determined as the 
sum of the expected federal funds rate implied by the scenario and the paths of the term premiums. 

Page 156 of 294 

 
 
In line with these guiding principles as well as those emphasized by the stress testing 

literature discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the Board considers the 

behavior of the 5-year Treasury yield during four financial stress episodes since the mid-1980s, 

including the 2007–2009 financial crisis, to calibrate the guide (Table 16).190  The average 

decline in the 5-year Treasury yield during those financial stress episodes has been around 2.7 

percentage points, ranging from 2.1 to 3.5 percentage points.191  Notably, the percentage-point 

decline in the 5-year yield across these recessions is consistent even though the level of the yield 

at the start of the period has varied considerably. 

190  In contrast with the calibration of other scenario variable guides, the Board considers the behavior of the 5-year 
Treasury yield during four financial stress episodes only after the mid-1980s. These financial stress episodes include 
NBER recessions in 1990Q3–1991Q1, 2001Q1–2001Q4, 2008Q3–2009Q2 (Lehman Brothers bankruptcy as a 
forcing event), and 2019Q4–2020Q2.  For the purposes of calibrating representative yield behavior during stress 
episodes, the Board chose to focus on the recessions since the mid-1980s, as the period after the mid-1980s is 
characterized by a major monetary policy regime shift and stabilization in the interest rate environment.  The mid-
1980s marked the end of the “Great Inflation,” an era that began in the mid-1960s and was characterized by 
persistently high inflation and accommodative monetary policy.  In response, monetary policy underwent a major 
regime shift in the early 1980s.  This regime shift began the era of “Great Moderation” marked by low and stable 
inflation and reduced macroeconomic volatility.  See, e.g., R. Clarida, J. Gali, & M. Gertler, Monetary Policy Rules 
and Macroeconomic Stability: Evidence and Some Theory, 115 Q. J. OF ECON. 147–80 (2000); Federal Reserve 
History, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, “Great Inflation,” https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-
inflation; Federal Reserve History, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, “Great Moderation,” 
https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-moderation. 

191 The average decline during all the NBER recessions starting from the 1969Q4–1970Q4 recession is 2.5 
percentage points, which is close to the average since the mid-1980s, but the range of declines is wider.

The evidence from the historical stress episodes along with the principle of conservatism 

and the goal of avoiding the addition of sources of procyclicality suggest that a decline of 1.5 to 

3.5 percentage points in the 5-year Treasury yield would be reasonable.  The lower end of the 

range (i.e., 1.5 percentage points) is somewhat below the historical average decline in the yield 

during financial stress episodes and in previous severely adverse scenarios (Table 14), leaving 

room to adjust the decline—and thus severity of the scenario—relative to the historical average.  

The 5-year yield declined by 2.1 percentage points during the 1990Q3–1991Q1 recession.   

The higher end of the range for the decline (i.e., 3.5 percentage points) is driven by 

observations in the data as well as the guiding principles: first, the largest decline in the 5-year 

yield during NBER recessions since the mid-1980s has been 3.5 percentage points.  This decline 

took place during the 2001Q1–2001Q4 recession.  However, outside recessions, there are 

episodes displaying more sizable drops in the 5-year yield over the horizon of 13 quarters 

(matching the scenario horizon), the declines ranging from 2.6 to 6.1 percentage points.  In 

192 Quarterly average of the yield on 5-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal Reserve staff based on the 
Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184.   

Page 158 of 294 

 
 
 
 
particular, the episode spanning 1984Q2–1987Q2 had a drop of 6.1 percentage points, the 

episode spanning 1990Q3–1993Q3 had a drop of 3.5 percentage points, and the episode 

spanning 1999Q4–2002Q4 had a drop of 3.1 percentage points.  These observations suggest that 

a decline of 3.5 percentage points in the 5-year yield is coherent with past experiences.  Second, 

allowing the 5-year yield to potentially fall more than what has been observed, on average, 

during past recessions speaks to the guiding principle that adequate severity might sometimes 

require a scenario that is somewhat beyond typical historical experiences.   

The guide also imposes a 0.3 percent lower bound for the value of the 5-year Treasury 

yield.  The Board opted for this near zero, albeit positive, lower bound for a few reasons.  First, 

the lower bound is intended to limit the extent that an annual scenario may unduly disincentivize 

bank lending when the economy is entering or recovering from a severe downturn.  Second, this 

choice increases the predictability of the 5-year Treasury yield path in the scenario.  Third, the 

lower bound is calibrated to be in line with the historical episodes.  The 5-year Treasury yield 

declined to similar levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 0.3 percent in 2020Q3.  

Finally, the guide imposes a decline of 0.3 percentage points in the yield when the jump-off 

value of the 5-year yield is close to or below its historical minimums at the scenario jump-off.  In 

particular, this element binds when the yield is below 0.6 percent at the jump-off.  This element 

further increases transparency on the yield trough level in the scenarios in various potential 

interest rate environments outside historical experiences. 

To illustrate how the trough levels of scenarios consistent with this guide would compare 

to the past stress test scenarios, consider the history of the 5-year yield and its scenario values at 

the trough over the period in which the Board has been conducting annual stress tests, from 2014 

to 2025 (Figure 4).  The past stress test scenario troughs are depicted as dots, whereas the range 

Page 159 of 294 

 
that is spanned by the proposed guide is indicated by the solid lines, incorporating the lower 

bound.  The dashed line depicts the quarterly average of the 5-year Treasury yield observed in 

the data.  This period contains both low- and high-interest rate environments: The quarterly 

average of the 5-year Treasury yield over that period was 2.1 percent, ranging between 0.3 and 

4.5 percent at the jump-off quarter.  

Figure 41:  Implied Range of the 5-year Treasury Yield, Trough Values of Past Scenarios, and 
Historical Data on the 5-year Treasury Yield (in percent)193 

During the periods in which the 5-year yield was below 1.7 percent, such as most 

quarters between 2013 and 2016, and 2020 to 2021, the guide would prescribe the lower bound 

for the 5-year yield.  In a higher-rate environment, however, a severe drop in the 5-year yield 

would not necessarily imply a yield close to zero, which the guide takes into an account.

Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184.  

Page 160 of 294 

 
 
 
 
Between 2017Q1 and 2019Q2, the interest rate environment was such that the decline in the 

yield within the range of 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points would have provided the Board with the 

discretion to choose trough levels in the range of 0.3 and 1.4 percent.  After 2022Q1, the 

proposed guide would have constrained the Board at times to a choice of yield levels 

significantly greater than the 0.3 percent lower bound.    

Figure 4 also illustrates that the troughs implied by the proposed guide are quantitatively 

close to, but not the same as those featured in the past stress test scenarios during the low-

interest-rate environment from 2013 to 2022 (the dots are located closer to the binding lower 

bound in most years).  In several of those years, the Board chose a level for the trough that was 

modestly above the level that would have been prescribed by the guide and in one case the Board 

chose a level below the guide.  However, with interest rates having risen to moderate levels 

between 2023 and 2025, the guide would have required the Board to choose a higher trough in 

2024 and 2025 than it did.   

The Board considers these deviations from past scenarios to be an acceptable 

consequence of adopting the guide, given its goal of increasing predictability and transparency in 

the stress test.  On the one hand, a more flexible guide, which would encompass a higher share of 

the past scenario troughs both in the lower and higher interest rate environments, would call for a 

wider range in the variable component of the guide.  While a wider range would increase 

scenario flexibility, it would come at the expense of predictability.  The proposed range strikes a 

balance between providing an adequate amount of flexibility to allow for adjusting scenario 

severity based on economic and financial conditions and keeping scenarios predictable.  On the 

other hand, keeping the range as is, one could also consider shifting the range up or down to 

better enclose the past scenario troughs.  If the range was shifted down (e.g., 1.0 to 3.0 percent), 

Page 161 of 294 

 
the guide would better encompass the past scenario troughs during the low-interest-rate periods, 

but the opposite would be true for the post-COVID-19 periods.  If the range was shifted up (e.g., 

2.0 to 4.0 percent), the guide would better encompass the past scenario troughs between 2023 

and 2025, but the lower bound would bind for a larger number of scenario troughs between 2013 

and 2021.  Thus, shifting the range would not meaningfully change how well the guide aligns 

with the past scenario troughs.  Lastly, as the deviations from past scenarios would have been in 

both directions, the Board expects that the proposed guide will be broadly consistent with 

maintaining an average level of severity of stress tests going forward that is similar to what it has 

been under the Scenario Design Policy Statement.  

In setting the 5-year Treasury yield trough value, the Board could consider the overall 

level of cyclical systemic risk, and the current level of the 5-year Treasury yield as a benchmark 

measure of overall economic and financing conditions.  As discussed earlier in Section IX.F of 

this Supplementary Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increment in the 5-year yield 

in consideration of observable cyclical systemic risk.  The Board would also consider how 

declines in Treasury yields, which decrease net income but increase the market value of firms’ 

long-term securities holdings, interact with the current vulnerabilities in the banking sector.  In 

general, a decline in long-term interest rates may have a positive or negative effect on the 

severity of the scenario for a given firm depending on the firm’s exposure to interest rate risk, 

which may vary from year to year depending on the firm’s portfolio.  In reaching its 

determination to set this guide in an annual scenario, the Board will consider how the choice 

would promote stress test credibility and the resilience of the financial system to even worse 

outcomes.  If the Board observes that cyclical systemic risks were increasing in a period of 

sustained robust expansion, the Board might choose a scenario that is more severe than normal.  

Page 162 of 294 

 
The choice would also depend on firms’ exposure to interest rate risk.  Conversely, the Board 

could specify a scenario that is less intense than normal in an environment where systemic risks 

appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of a recovery, provided that doing so remained 

consistent with the goal of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe 

economic and financial conditions.  A less severe scenario could also be appropriate when 

underlying market uncertainty and financial stress start to recede and higher-than-usual credit 

losses were either already realized—or are in the process of being realized—and thus removed 

from firms’ balance sheets.  The choice would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to 

remaining stress, thereby exacerbating the initial adverse shock, and it would be particularly 

appropriate if the Board judges that firms are already taking steps to reduce their risk.194 

Alternative Trough Guide Option 

As an alternative, the Board also considered a guide in which the 5-year Treasury yield 

would decline by 2.5 percentage points regardless of the jump-off conditions, with the lower 

bound still applying.  Under this alternative, the decline of 2.5 percentage points is chosen based 

on the same observations shown in Table 16.  In particular, 2.5 percentage points is close to the 

average decline in the 5-year Treasury yield observed during the financial stress episodes (2.7 

percentage points).  The choice of a single value in the middle of the range proposed in the 

proposed version of this guide reflects the offsetting effects of interest rates on net interest 

margin and fair value of securities.   

194 Evidence of market uncertainty and financial stress receding could include strong stock market performance or 
positive economic news related to GDP, inflation, unemployment or nonfarm payroll.  Evidence that credit losses 
are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases or loan-loss provisions in excess of gross 
charge-offs. 

Page 163 of 294 

 
 
 
The Board considered this alternative because of its goal of increasing transparency and 

predictability of the stress test, while maintaining sufficient severity.  However, the Board 

recognizes that this alternative guide would not avoid adding sources of procyclicality as 

effectively as the proposed guide.  In particular, it would reduce the Board’s flexibility during 

periods of moderate or high interest rates to test the resilience of firms’ net income to a sharper 

decline in interest rates.  However, as noted above, declines in yields have offsetting effects on 

firms’ regulatory capital in the stress test because they decrease net income but increase the 

market value of their long-term securities holdings.  Thus, a more flexible guide could have 

more-balanced effects on the stress capital buffer calculated from the stress test results.   

While the alternative troughs fall within the range determined by the proposed guide, 

these trough levels can be significantly higher or lower than the values chosen by the Board in 

prior severely adverse scenarios.  These deviations could impair the Board’s ability to ensure that 

the stress test severity fully considers the risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of 

economic and financial conditions, particularly those related to the Treasury term premium, 

when determining the trough value.  The Board views the alternative guide as reasonable.  As 

compared to the proposed guide, the alternative guide would provide firms and the public with 

increased predictability regarding the trough value to be set for 5-year Treasury yields.  

However, this increased predictability under the alternative guide comes at the expense of the 

added flexibility inherent in the proposed guide to set the trough based on risks that are apparent 

in relevant indicators of economic and financial conditions and to avoid adding sources of 

procyclicality in the proposed guide.  The purpose of the alternative guide discussion is to invite 

comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to transparently lay out the 

Board’s present arguments for choosing the proposed guide.

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Trough Value Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the trough and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The proposed guide suggests 

that the 5-year Treasury yield would reach the trough between quarters 1 and 4 of the scenario.  

This timing is chosen such that the trough is consistent with the scenario narrative: the severely 

adverse scenario is triggered by a sizeable financial shock combined with a pronounced increase 

in unemployment and decrease in inflation.  In response to these developments, both short- and 

long-term interest rates typically would fall sharply.  The timing of the trough is also broadly 

consistent with the historical data (Table 16).  Averaging across the four financial stress 

episodes, the trough is placed in the fifth quarter, but the trough occurred earlier during the two 

most recent recessions.195  The 5-year yield reached its trough in quarter 3 during the 2007–2009 

financial crisis and in quarter 4 during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the past stress test scenarios, 

the trough was also reached in quarter 3, on average.  In setting this part of the guide in an annual 

scenario, the Board expects to consider the same indicators and other factors described above for 

the choice of the trough in the 5-year rate, so as best to promote stress test credibility and the 

resilience of the financial system to even worse outcomes. 

Trajectory to Trough Value 

The proposed guide stipulates that the largest share of the decline in the 5-year Treasury 

yield would be realized in quarter 1.  A rapid, frontloaded decline of the 5-year yield to its trough 

195 These four episodes include 1990Q3–1991Q1, 2001Q1–2001Q4, 2008Q3–2009Q2 (Lehman Brothers 
bankruptcy as a forcing event), and 2019Q4–2020Q2 recessions. 

Page 165 of 294 

 
 
would be consistent with the scenario narrative and the implied dynamics of the other variables, 

mainly the large increase in unemployment and resulting declines in inflation and output.  In 

response to these developments, both short- and long-term interest rates would fall sharply, 

consistent with the Board’s macroeconomic model for stress testing, and specifically the 

expectational component of the 5-year Treasury yield, which accounts for the future expected 

realizations of the macro variables that determine the policy rate rule.196   

To determine the specific path of the 5-year Treasury yield for a given trough timing, the 

Board considered a simple formula that can map the trough value timing to a share of decline in 

quarter 1.  To do so, the Board considered lower and upper bound of trough timing described in 

the previous section.  If the trough timing is quarter 1 (e.g., lower bound of the range), then the 

formula should yield 100 percent of the decline occurring in the first quarter.  For trough timing 

of quarter 4, the Board took example of COVID-19 pandemic.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the 5-year yield reached its trough in quarter 4, and nearly 50 percent of the decline in the 5-year 

yield was realized during the first quarter.  Using these reference points, the Board concluded 

that the following simple formula could determine the approximate share of the decline realized 

in quarter 1 as:  

100% – 15% * (Trough value timing – 1).  

This simple formula stipulates that when the scenario trough is realized in quarter 4, 

about 55 percent of the decline would be realized in quarter 1: 

100% – 15% * (4-1) = 55%  

196 Existing studies suggest that it is beneficial to frontload interest rate cuts in response to shocks. See, e.g., R. 
Caballero & A. Simsek, A Note on Temporary Supply Shocks with Aggregate Demand Inertia, 5 AM. ECON. REV.: 
INSIGHTS 241–58 (2023); R. Caballero & A. Simsek, Monetary Policy and Asset Price Overshooting: a Rationale 
for the Wall/Main Street Disconnect, 79 J. OF FIN. 1719–53 (2024). 

Page 166 of 294 

 
 
This result is broadly in line – if not exactly in line – with the data from the COVID-19 

pandemic.  The guide also stipulates that, after the initial decline realized in quarter 1, the yield 

declines to its trough at smoothly decreasing percent reductions. 

10-Year Treasury Yield 

The stress test scenarios set out trajectories for several variables, including the 10-year 

Treasury yield, which is measured using the quarterly average of the yield on 10-year U.S. 

Treasury notes.197  Because banks generally engage in maturity transformation by borrowing 

short-term (i.e., deposits) to fund longer-term assets, fluctuations in interest rates can affect their 

financial health in various ways.  The 10-year Treasury yield is an important benchmark rate for 

credit markets and is, thus, directly related to the profitability of firms’ investments in loans and 

securities as well as their trading activities.  For example, a decline in longer-term Treasury 

yields that exceeds the decline in short-term yields (known as a flattening of the yield curve) 

tends to compress firms’ net interest margins and can therefore reduce their profitability.  At the 

same time, the decline in such yields tends to increase the value of firms’ investments in long-

term fixed-rate bonds, some of which is reflected in various measures of capital at firms.198  

Incorporating the 10-year Treasury yield into the supervisory stress test helps to ensure that firms 

are prepared for a wide range of market conditions, including periods with a sudden decline in a 

credit market benchmark rate.  This helps maintain the overall stability and resilience of the 

financial system. 

197 This series is constructed by the Board based on the Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson 
(1995), supra note 184184.  

198 The change in the fair value of securities held for sale is reflected in common equity for all firms and in common 
equity tier 1 for firms subject to Category I and Category II standards, as well as firms that opt into that treatment.  
See 12 CFR Part 252. 

Page 167 of 294 

 
 
The Board uses a quarterly average of the 10-year Treasury yield in the stress test 

scenarios.  Quarterly averages smooth out excessive (and potentially irrelevant) volatility that is 

present at daily or even monthly frequencies.  Using quarterly averages strikes a balance between 

being sensitive enough to capture market trends and stable enough to avoid overreaction to 

market noise.  Relatedly, the 10-year yield reflects long-term expectations of overall economic 

conditions.  Therefore, removing short-term volatility from this measure via quarterly averaging 

is likely to, more-often-than-not, result in a better representation of current macroeconomic 

conditions.  

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to scenario 

design principles discussed in the earlier Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While 

doing so, the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the 

financial system.  In the context of the 10-year yield, these principles are applied in calibrating 

three key aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of the trough value, and the trajectory 

to trough.  This approach helps ensure that the 10-year yield guide aligns with the established 

stress testing literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the financial system.  

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Table 17 presents an overview of 

the 10-year Treasury yield guide components, followed by the guide description of the trough 

component.  The next subsection provides the data- and scenario-based rationale for the 

calibration of the trough component.  A discussion of an alternative trough option follows in the 

next subsection, comparing the implementation and caveats to the proposed guide option.  

Finally, additional guide parameters (trough value timing and trajectory to the peak) and the 

rationale for their calibration are discussed.

a. 

Trough Value Component of the Proposed Guide  

The 10-year Treasury yield decreases from its starting value by between 1.0 to 3.0 

percentage points.  The Board will determine the size of an annual scenario’s decline based on a 

number of factors, including relevant banking, macroeconomic, or other conditions in the 

economy or financial markets.199  Additionally, the size of the decline will be informed by (a) the 

behavior of short-term interest rates in the macroeconomic model for stress testing that the Board 

has developed specifically to aid in communicating the stress test scenario to the public,200 (b) 

estimates of the likely term premiums in period of economic weakness consistent with the 

scenario narrative, and (c) risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial 

conditions.201  However, the guide restricts the 10-year Treasury yield from falling below a 

199 Depending on the level of short-term interest rates, in some scenarios, the short-term rate could reach its trough 
slower than the 5-year and 10-year yields.  In those cases, the scenario would include the inversion of the yield 
curve in the first few scenario quarters.  Such behavior is in line with past scenarios as well as behavior of interest 
rates in past stress episodes, like the 2001Q1–2001Q4 recession, the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

200 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm. 

201 In the macroeconomic model for stress testing, the path of the 10-year Treasury yield is determined as the sum of 
the expected federal funds rate implied by the scenario and the paths of the term premiums.

lower bound of 0.5 percent or a decline of 0.3 percentage points from the jump-off level, 

whichever is lower.  

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Proposed Trough Value 

In the recession approach chosen by the Board, risk-free long-term interest rates fall 

because reduced economic activity and inflation result in an easing of monetary policy.  As noted 

above, declining interest rates can have both positive and negative implications for firms’ capital 

levels, depending on the firm’s business model and the specific composition of its assets and 

liabilities at the start of the stress test.   

In line with these guiding principles as well as those emphasized by the stress testing 

literature discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the Board considers the 

behavior of the 10-year Treasury yield during four financial stress episodes since the mid-1980s, 

including the 2007–2009 financial crisis, to calibrate the guide (Table 18).202  The average 

decline in the 10-year Treasury yield during those financial stress episodes has been around 1.9 

percentage points, ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 percentage points.203  Notably, the percentage-point 

decline in the 10-year yield across these recessions is similar even though the level of the yield at 

the start of the period has varied considerably. 

202 In contrast with the calibration of other scenario variable guides, the Board considers the behavior of the 10-year 
Treasury yield during four financial stress episodes only after the mid-1980s.  These financial stress episodes 
include NBER recessions in 1990Q3–1991Q1, 2001Q1–2001Q4, 2008Q3–2009Q2 (Lehman Brothers bankruptcy as 
a forcing event), and 2019Q4–2020Q2.  For the purposes of calibrating representative yield behavior during stress 
episodes, the Board chose to focus on the recessions since the mid-1980s, as the period after the mid-1980s is 
characterized by a major monetary policy regime shift and stabilization in the interest rate environment.  The mid-
1980s marked the end of the “Great Inflation,” an era that began in the mid-1960s and was characterized by 
persistently high inflation and accommodative monetary policy.  In response, monetary policy underwent a major 
regime shift in the early 1980s.  This regime shift began the era of “Great Moderation” marked by low and stable 
inflation and reduced macroeconomic volatility.  See supra note 190. 
203 The average decline during all the NBER recessions starting from the 1973Q4–1975Q1 recession—the first 
NBER recession for which the 10-year Treasury yield data is available—is also 1.9 percentage points, but the range 
of declines is wider.

The evidence from the historical stress episodes along with the principle of conservatism 

and the goal of avoiding the addition of sources of procyclicality suggest that a decline of 1.0 to 

3.0 percentage points in the 10-year Treasury yield would be reasonable.  The lower end of the 

range (i.e., 1.0 percentage points) is somewhat below the historical average decline in the yield 

during financial stress episodes and in previous severely adverse scenarios (Table 18), leaving 

room to adjust the decline—and thus severity of the scenario—relative to the historical average.  

The 10-year yield declined by 1.3 percentage points during the 1990Q3–1991Q1 recession.  

The higher end of the range for the decline (i.e., 3.0 percentage points) is driven by 

observations in the data as well as the guiding principles: first, the largest decline in the 10-year 

yield during NBER recessions since the mid-1980s has been 2.4 percentage points.  This decline 

took place during both the 2001Q1–2001Q4 recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, 

outside recessions, there are episodes displaying more sizeable drops in the 10-year yield over 

the horizon of 13 quarters (matching the scenario horizon), the declines ranging from 2.2 to 5.8 

204 Source: Quarterly average of the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal Reserve staff 
based on the Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184.

percentage points.  In particular, the episode spanning 1984Q2–1987Q2 had a drop of 5.8 

percentage points, the episode spanning 1990Q3–1993Q3 had a drop of 3.0 percentage points, 

the episode spanning 1999Q4–2002Q4 had a drop of 2.2 percentage points, and the episode 

spanning 2018Q4–2021Q4 had a drop of 2.4 percentage points.  These observations suggest that 

a decline of 3.0 percentage points in the 10-year yield is coherent with past experiences.  Second, 

allowing the 10-year yield to potentially fall more than what has been observed during past 

recessions, on average, speaks to the guiding principle that adequate severity should be 

somewhat beyond historical experiences.  

The guide also imposes a 0.5 percent lower bound for the value of the 10-year Treasury 

yield.  The Board opted for this near zero, albeit positive, lower bound for a few reasons.  First, 

the lower bound is intended to limit the extent that an annual scenario may unduly disincentivize 

bank lending when the economy is entering or recovering from a severe downturn.  Second, this 

choice increases the predictability of the 10-year Treasury yield path in the scenario.  Third, the 

lower bound is in line with the historical episodes.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined to 

similar levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 0.6 percent in 2020Q3, but it has never 

fallen below that level.  Finally, the guide imposes a decline of 0.3 percentage points in the yield 

when the jump-off value of the 10-year yield is close to or below its historical minimums at the 

scenario jump-off.  In particular, this element binds when the yield is below 0.8 percent at the 

jump-off. This element further increases transparency on the yield trough level in the scenarios in 

various potential interest rate environments outside historical experiences. 

To illustrate how the trough levels of scenarios consistent with this guide would compare 

to the past stress test scenarios, consider the history of the 10-year yield and its scenario values at 

the trough over the period in which the Board has been conducting annual stress tests, from 2014 

Page 172 of 294 

 
to 2025 (Figure 5).  The past stress test scenario troughs are depicted as dots, whereas the range 

that is spanned by the proposed guide is indicated by the solid lines, which incorporate the lower 

bound.  The dashed line depicts the quarterly average of the 10-year Treasury yield observed in 

the data.  This period contains both low- and high-interest rate environments, and the quarterly 

average of the 10-year Treasury yield (depicted as a dashed line) has been 2.5 percent, with a 

range between 0.6 and 4.5 percent at the jump-off quarter.  

Figure 5:  Implied Range of the 10-year Treasury Yield, Trough Values of Past Scenarios, and 
Historical Data on the 10-year Treasury Yield (in percent)205 

For periods when the 10-year yield is below 1.5 percent, such as the period surrounding 

the COVID-19 pandemic, the guide would prescribe the lower bound for the 10-year yield.  In 

other periods between 2013–2025, the 10-year yield has been high enough such that the lower 

bound of the guide is not strictly binding after applying the minimum amount of decline in the

guide.  In a higher-rate environment, a severe drop in the 10-year yield would not necessarily 

imply a yield close to zero.  Figure 5 illustrates that the range of troughs consistent with the 

proposed guide usually includes the values featured in the past stress test scenarios during the 

low-interest-rate environment from 2013 to 2022 (the dots are located within the guide-

prescribed range, or close to the binding lower bound in most years).  In three of those years, the 

Board chose a level for the trough that was above the maximum level that would have been 

allowed by the guide and in two cases the Board chose a level modestly below the minimum 

level consistent with guide.  With interest rates having risen to moderate levels between 2023 

and 2025, the guide would have required the Board to choose a slightly higher trough in 2023 

and 2025 and a notably higher trough in 2024 than the Board chose in those scenarios.   

The Board considers these deviations from past scenarios to be an acceptable 

consequence of adopting the guide, given its goal of increasing predictability and transparency in 

the stress test.  As the deviations from past scenarios would have been in both directions, the 

Board expects that the proposed guide will be broadly consistent with maintaining an average 

level of severity of stress tests going forward that is similar to what it has been under the 

previous scenario design framework. 

In setting the 10-year Treasury yield trough value, the Board could consider the overall 

level of cyclical systemic risk, and the current level of the 10-year Treasury yield as a benchmark 

measure of overall economic and financing conditions.  As discussed in earlier Section IX.F of 

this Supplementary Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increment in the 10-year yield 

in consideration of observable cyclical systemic risk.  The Board would also consider how 

declines in Treasury yields, which decrease net income but increase the market value of firms’ 

long-term securities holdings, interact with the current vulnerabilities in the banking sector.  In 

Page 174 of 294 

 
general, a decline in long-term interest rates may have a positive or negative effect on the 

severity of the scenario for a given firm depending on the firm’s exposure to interest rate risk, 

which may vary from year to year depending on the firm’s portfolio.  In reaching its 

determination to set this guide in an annual scenario, the Board will consider how the choice 

would promote stress test credibility and the resilience of the financial system to even worse 

outcomes.   

If the Board observes that cyclical systemic risks were increasing in a period of sustained 

robust expansion, the Board might choose a scenario that is more intense than normal.  The 

choice would also depend on firms’ exposure to interest rate risk.  Conversely, the Board could 

specify a scenario that is less intense than normal in an environment where systemic risks 

appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of a recovery, provided that doing so remained 

consistent with the goal of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe 

economic and financial conditions.  A less severe scenario could also be appropriate when 

underlying market uncertainty and financial stress start to recede and higher-than-usual credit 

losses were either already realized—or are in the process of being realized—and thus removed 

from firms’ balance sheets.  The choice would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to 

remaining stress, thereby exacerbating the initial adverse shock, and it would be particularly 

appropriate if the Board judges that firms are already taking steps to reduce their risk—for 

instance, by potentially restricting lending to otherwise qualified borrowers.206 

206 Evidence of market uncertainty and financial stress receding could include strong stock market performance or 
positive economic news related to GDP, inflation, unemployment, or nonfarm payroll.  Evidence that credit losses 
are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases or loan-loss provisions in excess of gross 
charge-offs. 

Page 175 of 294 

 
 
 
Alternative Trough Guide Option 

As an alternative, the Board considered a guide in which the 10-year Treasury yield 

would decline by 2.0 percentage points regardless of the jump-off conditions.  The lower bound 

would still bind.  The decline of 2.0 percentage points is chosen based on the same observations 

shown in Table 18.  In particular, 2.0 percentage points is close to the average decline in the 10-

year Treasury yield observed during the financial stress episodes (1.9 percentage points) and the 

average decline in previous severely adverse scenarios (1.7 percentage points).  The choice of a 

single value in the middle of the range proposed in the more flexible version of this guide 

balances the offsetting effects of interest rates on net interest margin and fair value of securities.  

The Board considered this alternative because of its goal of increasing transparency and 

predictability of the stress test, while maintaining sufficient severity.  The Board recognizes that 

this alternative guide would not avoid adding sources of procyclicality as effectively as the 

proposed guide.  In particular, it would reduce the Board’s flexibility during periods of moderate 

or high interest rates to test the resilience of firms’ net income to a sharper decline in interest 

rates.  However, as noted above, declines in yields have offsetting effects on firms’ regulatory 

capital in the stress test because they decrease net income but increase the market value of their 

long-term securities holdings.  Thus, a more flexible guide would allow the Board to balance its 

assessment of these two vulnerabilities in the stress test scenario.   

While the alternative troughs fall within the range determined by the proposed guide, 

these trough levels can be significantly higher or lower than the values chosen by the Board in 

prior severely adverse scenarios.  These deviations could impair the ability of the Board to 

ensure the stress test severity that fully considers the risks that are apparent in relevant indicators 

of economic and financial conditions, particularly those related to inflation and inflation

expectations, when determining the trough value.  The Board views the alternative guide as 

reasonable.  Compared to the proposed guide, the alternative guide would provide firms and the 

public with increased predictability regarding the trough value to be set for 10-year Treasury 

yields.  However, this increased predictability under the alternative guide comes at the expense 

of the added flexibility inherent in the proposed guide to set the trough based on risks that are 

apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial conditions and to avoid adding sources 

of procyclicality in the proposed guide.  The purpose of the alternative guide discussion is to 

invite comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to transparently lay out 

the Board’s present arguments for choosing the proposed guide.

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Trough Value Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the trough and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The proposed guide suggests 

that the 10-year Treasury yield would reach the trough in quarters 1 to 4 of the scenario.  This 

timing is chosen such that the trough is consistent with the scenario narrative: the severely 

adverse scenario is triggered by a sizeable financial shock combined with a pronounced increase 

in unemployment and decrease in inflation.  In response to these developments, both short- and 

long-term interest rates typically would fall sharply.  The timing of the trough is also broadly 

consistent with the historical data (Table 18).  Averaging across the four financial stress 

episodes, the trough is placed in the sixth quarter, but the trough occurred earlier during the two 

Page 177 of 294 

 
most recent recessions.207  The 10-year yield reached its trough in quarter 3 during the 2007–

2009 financial crisis and in quarter 4 during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the past stress test 

scenarios, the trough was reached in quarter 1, on average.  In setting this part of the guide in an 

annual scenario, the Board will consider the same indicators and other factors described above 

for the choice of the trough in the 10-year rate, so as best to promote stress test credibility and 

the resilience of the financial system to even worse outcomes.  

Trajectory to Trough Value 

The proposed guide stipulates that the largest share of the decline in the 10-year Treasury 

yield would be realized in quarter 1.  A rapid, frontloaded decline of the 10-year yield to its 

trough would be consistent with the scenario narrative and the implied dynamics of the other 

variables, mainly a large rise in unemployment and resulting declines in inflation and output.  In 

response to these developments, both short- and long-term interest rates would fall sharply, 

consistent with the Board’s macroeconomic model for stress testing, because the expectational 

component of the 10-year Treasury yield accounts for the future expected realizations of the 

macro variables that determine the policy rate rule.208   

To determine the specific path of the 10-year Treasury yield for a given trough timing, 

the Board considered a simple formula that can map the trough value timing to a share of decline 

in quarter 1.  To do so, the Board considered lower and upper bound of trough timing described 

in the previous section.  If the trough timing is quarter 1 (e.g., lower bound of the range), then the 

formula should yield 100 percent of the decline occurring in the first quarter.  For trough timing 

of quarter 4, the Board took example of COVID-19 pandemic.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, 

207 These four episodes include 1990Q3–1991Q1, 2001Q1–2001Q4, 2008Q3–2009Q2 (Lehman Brothers 
bankruptcy as a forcing event), and 2019Q4–2020Q2 recessions. 
208 See supra note 196196. 

Page 178 of 294 

 
 
the 10-year yield reached its trough in quarter 4, and 52 percent of the decline in the 10-year 

yield was realized during the first quarter.  Using these reference points, the Board concluded 

that the following simple formula could set the approximate share of the decline realized in 

quarter 1 as:  

100% – 15% * (Trough value timing – 1).  

This simple formula stipulates that when the scenario trough is realized in Quarter 4, 

about 55 percent of the decline would be realized in Quarter 1: 

100% – 15% * (4-1) = 55%  

This is broadly in line – if not exactly in line – with the data from the COVID-19 

pandemic.  The guide also stipulates that, after the initial decline realized in quarter 1, the yield 

declines to its trough at smoothly decreasing percent reductions. 

BBB Yield 

The stress test scenarios set out the trajectory of the BBB corporate spread, measured by 

the quarterly average of ICE BofA U.S. Corporate 7-10 Year Yield-to-Maturity Index relative to 

the 10-year Treasury yield.209  The BBB corporate spread represents the performance of 

corporate debt rated as investment grade by a major ratings agency.  

Although firms subject to the supervisory stress test do not hold substantial volumes of 

BBB corporate bonds on their balance sheets, they make business loans to large- and middle-

market firms and hold other types of business debt on their balance sheets, e.g., commercial and 

industrial (C&I) loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).  Corporate bond spreads and 

CLO spreads tend to move together in times of financial stress and high uncertainty.  C&I loans 

209 The source for the BBB corporate spread series is ICE BofAML U.S. Corporate 7-10 Year Yield-to-Maturity 
Index, ICE Data Indices, LLC, (C4A4 series).  The 10-year yield is computed as the quarterly average of the yield 
on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal Reserve staff based on the Svensson smoothed term 
structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184.  

Page 179 of 294 

 
 
to large- and middle-market firms, some of whom are also issuers of corporate bonds, account 

for 65 percent of total C&I loans.  Because of these similarities with bond-issuing firms, changes 

in business conditions that underlie changes in spreads on BBB corporate bonds would affect 

these borrowers as well (and hence the balance sheets of the stress tested firms).  In fact, 

empirical research finds that bank borrowers are more sensitive to macroeconomic and financial 

shocks than publicly-traded borrowers due to their relatively more-restricted access to funding 

resources.  Hence, in the context of the severely adverse scenario, the Board views BBB 

corporate bond spreads as a measure representing conditions in the business sector more 

generally. 

Instead of a higher frequency, such as daily, for which the underlying data is available, 

the Board uses a quarterly average of the BBB spreads in the stress test scenario for several 

reasons.  First, BBB bonds face liquidity issues and their prices can be quite volatile at higher 

frequencies for reasons unrelated to underlying business conditions.210  Using quarterly averages 

strikes a balance between being sensitive enough to capture market trends and stable enough to 

avoid overreaction to high-frequency volatility.  Relatedly, as noted above, in the context of 

stress testing, the BBB spreads provide a good representation of business borrowing and 

underlying economic confidence.  Therefore, removing short-term noise from this measure via 

quarterly averaging results in a more reasonable representation of underlying business borrowing 

conditions.  

210 There is empirical support for excessive volatility in corporate bonds and find that it has little relation to firm 
fundamentals.  J. Bao, & J. Pan, Bond Illiquidity and Excess Volatility, 26 REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 3068–
3103 (2013).  In a working version of the paper, the authors stress that such excessive volatility is pervasive at 
higher frequencies, being the strongest at daily and weekly horizons and staying significant at monthly horizons.  J.

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to scenario 

design principles discussed in the earlier Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While 

doing so, the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the 

financial system.  In the context of the BBB spreads, these principles are applied in calibrating 

three key aspects of the guide: the peak value, the timing of the peak value, and the trajectory to 

peak.  This approach helps ensure that the BBB spread guide aligns with the established stress 

testing literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the financial system. 

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, an overview of the BBB spread 

guide components is given in Table 19, which is followed by the description of the component of 

the guide that determines the peak of the spread.  The next subsection provides the data- and 

scenario-based rationale for the calibration of the peak component.  Next is a discussion of an 

alternative calibration for the peak component, comparing the implementation and caveats to the 

proposed guide option.  Finally, additional guide parameters (peak value timing and trajectory to 

the peak) and the rationale for their calibration are discussed.

Peak Value Component of the Guide 

The BBB corporate bond yield is expected to move such that its spread relative to the 10-

year Treasury yield would either increase from its initial level by 100 basis points or to a level 

ranging between 500 and 600 basis points, whichever results in a higher level.  

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Peak Value 

In line with the guiding principles emphasized by the stress testing literature and 

discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the Board references the behavior 

of the BBB spreads during financial stress episodes, including the 2007–2009 financial crisis, to 

calibrate the guide for BBB spreads in the supervisory stress test scenarios.  The higher end of 

the range for the peak level (i.e., 600 basis points) corresponds to the quarterly-average peak 

value observed during the 2007–2009 financial crisis (Table 19).  Additionally, weekly averages 

of the BBB spread peaked at 688 basis points over the same period.211  The lower end of the 

range for the peak level (500 basis points) is motivated by the data as well.  A level of 500 basis 

points also constitutes a severe BBB spread value from a statistical point of view.212  At daily 

frequency, the BBB spread reached values of around 500 basis points several times during the 

2007–2009 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic the BBB spread reached about 

450 basis points.213   

211 Weekly average calculated using ICE BofA U.S. Corporate 7-10 Year Yield-to-Maturity Index (ICE Data 
Indices, LLC) and the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal Reserve staff based on the 
Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184. 

212 For instance, in the weekly data from December 1988 through February 2025, 500 basis points and 600 basis 
points represent the top (i.e., the riskiest) percentiles of the BBB spread historical distribution: 98.5 and the 99.3, 
respectively. 

213 The daily frequency BBB spread peak during the COVID-19 pandemic measured about 450 basis points, before 
declining after unprecedented government support programs were announced in March of 2020.  Stress tests are 
designed to assess firms in the absence of such government support.  During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the 
weeks in which spreads exceeded 500 basis points preceded the weeks with even higher BBB spread values. 

Page 182 of 294 

 
 
These examples illustrate that the value of 500 basis points represents a severe point in 

the historical distribution of the BBB spread observed during crisis events, which could be 

followed by further worsening of conditions.  Even if peaks of 500 to 600 basis points have been 

rather short-lived, they could potentially trigger events that would cause inadequately capitalized 

firms to fire-sale their assets— a risk the Board seeks to reduce through the use of stress testing.  

Moreover, setting a floor for the BBB spread at 500 basis points recognizes that, not only are 

cyclical systemic risks likely to build up at financial intermediaries during robust expansions, but 

that these risks are also easily obscured by a buoyant environment. 

To ensure sufficient severity in the event that the BBB spread at the start of a stress test 

cycle is around or higher than the peak levels attained in the history (e.g., above 500 basis 

points), the Board contemplates a minimum increment of 100 basis points, in line with the 

principle that adequate severity requires a guide to be able to go somewhat beyond historical 

experiences when initial conditions warrant.214  The minimum increment of 100 basis points 

ensures adequate scenario severity, maintaining the credibility of the stress test while at the same 

time constraining the peak from becoming unduly contractionary and deviating too far from 

historically observed levels.215  Applying a larger value of a minimum increment (e.g., 200 basis 

points) could result in a peak level that is unjustifiably distant from historical peaks and might 

not allow the Board to reflect near-term changes, such as emerging signs of financial 

stabilization, resulting in inappropriately high scenario severity at a time when the economy and 

financial markets are already stressed.   

214 See Schuermann (2014), supra note 99.   
215 If a future financial distress event causes the BBB spread to rise beyond the current peak of about 600 basis 
points, the Board may consider an update of the peak range to reflect that new empirical evidence in subsequent 
future tests.

episodes (based on data availability): 1990Q3–1991Q1, 2001Q1–2001Q4, 2008Q3–2009Q2, 2019Q4–2020Q2; (2) 
For timing purposes, the stress episode of the 2007–2009 Financial Crisis recession is considered to start  in

across binding scenarios from 2014–2025; (4) Peak value corresponds to the maximum spread achieved during or in 
the four quarters after a financial stress episode; (5) Jump-off corresponds to the minimum value of the variable in 
the four quarters before, and the first quarter of the financial stress period; (6) Peak timing corresponds to the quarter 
the maximum (the peak) value is achieved.216  

To illustrate how the Board would use this guide to formulate the scenarios, and how the 

implied peak levels of the guides compare to the past stress test scenarios, consider the jump-off 

values in 2014–2025 cycles, the period during which the Board has been conducting stress tests 

(Figure 6).  The past stress test scenario peaks are depicted as dots in the figure, whereas the 

proposed guide is indicated as a range by the solid lines.  This period contains both stressful 

times (the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as the slow recovery after 2009 and some periods of 

very low unemployment and robust growth.  It is therefore quite representative in capturing a 

variety of jump-off values.  In this time frame, the quarterly average of the BBB spread (depicted 

as a dashed line) has been between about 100 and 265 basis points at the jump-off quarter, while 

the average of those quarterly jump-off values was about 170 basis points.  Going to 500 or 600 

basis points from such jump-off values represented a substantial increase in the spread, possibly 

more than 400 basis points.  This is a plausible increase when markets become strained or bad 

216  Federal Reserve staff calculated BBB spread using the U.S. BBB corporate yield, computed using the quarterly 
average of ICE BofAML U.S. Corporate 7-10 Year Yield-to-Maturity Index (ICE Data Indices, LLC, C4A4 series), 
and the quarterly average of the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal Reserve staff based on 
the Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184.

economic news pervades.  For instance, during the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the difference 

between the average BBB spread during 2007Q3 and the BBB spread at the peak that episode 

(2008Q4) amounted to 431 basis points (Table 20). 

Figure 6 also illustrates that the peak range of 500 to 600 basis points implied by the 

proposed guide brackets the peak values of the BBB spread used in the past stress test scenarios 

(the dots are located within or on the borders outlined by the solid lines throughout the time span 

of the figure).  In other words, the proposed guide is consistent with the Board’s past stress test 

practices in determining the peak.

Past Scenarios, and Historical Data on BBB corporate yields less 10-year Treasury Yield (in

uncertainty and financial stress.  As discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary 

Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increment in the BBB spreads based on its views 

of the status of cyclical systemic risk.  Specifically, the Board would be more likely to set the 

BBB spreads peak value at the higher end of the range if the Board expects that cyclical systemic 

risks are high (as it would be after a sustained long expansion), and alternatively would be more 

likely to set the peak value to the lower end of the range if cyclical systemic risks are low (as it 

would be in the earlier stages of a recovery), provided doing so remained consistent with the goal 

of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe economic and financial 

conditions.  This might result in a scenario that is more severe than normal if the Board expects 

that cyclical systemic risks were increasing in a period of sustained robust expansion.   

Conversely, it would also allow the Board to specify a scenario that is less severe than 

normal in an environment where systemic risks appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of 

a recovery. The lower end of the increase range could also be appropriate when underlying 

market uncertainty and financial stress start to recede and higher-than-usual credit losses 

stemming from previous elevated levels of the BBB spreads were either already realized—or are 

in the process of being realized—and thus removed from firms’ balance sheets.  This choice 

would consider that the scenario does not add unduly to remaining stress, thereby exacerbating 

the initial adverse shock, and it would be particularly appropriate if the Board judges that firms 

are already taking steps to reduce their risk; for instance, by potentially restricting lending to 

otherwise qualified borrowers.218 

218 Evidence of market uncertainty and financial stress receding could include decreased defaults in public bond 
markets, strong stock market performance or positive economic news related to GDP, unemployment or nonfarm 
payroll.  Evidence that credit losses are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and leases or 
loan-loss provisions in excess of gross charge-offs. 

Page 186 of 294 

 
 
Alternative Peak Guide Option 

As an alternative, the Board also considered a guide that would choose a peak level as a 

maximum between 600 basis points and an increase from the jump-off value by 100 basis points.  

The justification for considering this peak calibration is as follows.  Unlike the proposed guide, 

the alternative allows for less discretion and therefore would provide more certainty to firms and 

to market participants about the severity of the stress test each year.  However, the Board 

considered the importance of ensuring that the chosen calibration would be sufficiently severe, 

because, as noted above, insufficiently severe stress tests can undermine the credibility of the 

results.  Therefore, to attain adequate scenario severity for this option, the Board considered the 

peak calibration level of 600 basis points—the value corresponding to the BBB spread peak 

observed during the 2007–2009 financial crisis and the upper bound of the range considered for 

the proposed guide.  This alternative guide could be less desirable as it is less flexible and may 

end up being too severe, especially during economic downturns, when the proposed guide would 

offer the flexibility to choose a lower peak from the range that could avoid adding sources of 

procyclicality in the results.  

Consider the application of the alternative guide in 2013–2024 against the peaks of past 

scenarios and the proposed guide.  Given the initial conditions in this time period, the alternative 

guide would prescribe the 600 basis points for the peak value in all quarters of the considered 

time span.  Compared with the past stress tests, such prescriptions are often more severe, 

resulting in the peaks that can be as much as 100 basis points higher than those of the past stress 

tests.  

Although the proposed and the alternative guides are both discussed, and the Board views 

the alternative guide as reasonable, it was judged to be inferior to the proposed guide as 

Page 187 of 294 

 
discussed in this section.  The purpose of the alternative guide discussion is to invite comment on 

a reasonable alternative considered by the Board and to transparently lay out the Board’s present 

arguments for choosing the proposed guide.   

b. 

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them  

Peak Value Timing  

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the peak and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The guide stipulates that the 

peak level in the scenario would be reached in quarter 3 or quarter 4, which is consistent with 

historical observations.  In post-war recessions, the BBB spread reached its peak in quarter 4 (on 

average), whereas the 2007–2009 financial crisis yields a peak in quarter 2 (see Table 20).  The 

empirical literature that studies responses of corporate spreads to shocks (e.g., unexpected 

increases in uncertainty or financial riskiness) often documents a delayed peak.  For instance, the 

response of the corporate spread to an uncertainty shock can peak after month 6 (into quarter 3) 

in the U.S. data.219  In the past stress test scenarios, the peak was also reached in quarter 4, on 

average.  

The Board expects that the timing of the start of the stress period should sometimes differ 

from the start date of the recession determined by the NBER.  For potentially fast-moving 

variables (such as BBB spread, equity prices or VIX), the Board times the onset of the stress 

period during the 2007–2009 Financial Crisis based on the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy on 

September 15, 2008.  This event is widely considered to be the most significant of the events that 

219 See Caldara (2016), supra note 182182182.  The delayed peak feature is particularly prominent for the Jurado et 
al. (2015) measure of uncertainty—a widely accepted measure in this literature.  K. Jurado et al., Measuring 
Uncertainty, 105 AM. ECON. REV. 1177–1216 (2015).  

Page 188 of 294 

 
 
roiled financial markets during the 2007–2009 Financial Crisis.220  As stress test data operate at 

quarterly frequency, the Board’s timing of this event for purposes of dating the peak of the BBB 

corporate spread is in 2008Q3.  Indeed, the BBB corporate spread remained largely flat between 

2008Q1 and 2008Q2, rising somewhat in 2008Q3 (because the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy 

occurred close to the end of the quarter, it had little effect on the quarterly average) before 

increasing sharply to the observed maximum in 2008Q4.221  Therefore, the focus on the Lehman 

Bankruptcy as the triggering event is more consistent with the stress test scenario narrative in 

which a financial shock sets the stress test scenario dynamics in motion than the NBER recession 

date.     

Trajectory to Peak Value   

To reach the peak spread value, the guide prescribes that the highest share of the spread 

increase (about 60 to 80 percent) occurs in the first quarter of the scenario.  Such frontloading of 

the spread increase is consistent with the historical evidence and academic literature.222  For 

instance, in the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the largest increase in the spread (about 67 percent of 

the jump-off.  A very similar result emerges when considering the Enron/Dotcom stress episode 

220 See, e.g., R. Wiggins et al., The Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy A: Overview, 1 JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL CRISES 39–
62 (2019). 

221 Demonstrated by the calculation of the BBB spread over time using the U.S. BBB corporate yield, computed 
using the quarterly average of ICE BofAML U.S. Corporate 7-10 Year Yield-to-Maturity Index (ICE Data Indices, 
LLC, C4A4 series), and the quarterly average of the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, constructed by Federal 
Reserve staff based on the Svensson smoothed term structure model.  See Svensson (1995), supra note 184184. 
222 In the academic literature, spreads are well-known to be contemporaneous indicators that move the most at the 
onset of a stress event or crisis.  For instance, Krishnamurthy (2025) documents rapid changes in spreads at the onset 
of financial crises, whereas Bernanke (2005) classify spreads and stock market prices as “fast-moving” variables 
that respond to shocks on impact.  A. Krishnamurthy & T. Muir, How Credit Cycles across a Financial Crisis, 80 J. 
OF FIN. 1339–78 (2025) (“Krishnamurthy (2025)”); B. Bernanke et al., Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy: A 
Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) Approach, 120 Q. J. OF ECON. 387–422 (2005).  Caldara (2016), 
supra note 182182, provides empirical evidence of such behavior of spreads in response to financial shocks and 
uncertainty shocks.   

Page 189 of 294 

 
 
and 1990 bond market stress episode.223  On average (across all three bond market stress 

episodes), about 66 percent of the increase to the peak in the spread was realized in a single 

quarter after the onset of the stress episode.  After quarter one and until the peak is reached, the 

guide stipulates a smooth trajectory with half of the remaining adjustment made in quarter two 

and with the rest of the adjustment made either in quarter three (when the peak occurs in quarter 

three) or equally distributed between quarter three and four (when the peak occurs in quarter 

four).  As an example, if the increase share in the first quarter was around 60 percent, then the 

adjustment in quarter two would be about 20 percent with the remaining 20 percent in quarter 

three (if the peak is in quarter three) or with the remaining distributed approximately 10 percent 

each in quarter three and four (if the peak is in quarter four). This simple adjustment rule mimics 

a hump-shaped response of the corporate spread to shocks, a feature well-documented in the 

empirical literature.224   

Mortgage Rate 

The stress test scenarios sets out trajectories for several variables, including the mortgage 

spread as proxied by the quarterly average of weekly series for the interest rate of a conventional, 

conforming, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, obtained from the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage 

Market Survey relative to the 10-year Treasury yield.225  For purposes of this guide, mortgage

spread refers to the difference, in basis points, between mortgage and Treasury rates defined 

above.   

In the supervisory stress test, the mortgage spread can act as both (i) an indicator of stress 

for certain important assets under the scenarios and (ii) a source of stress for firms subject to the 

supervisory stress test with substantial exposure to assets that are tied to mortgage spreads, such 

as mortgage loan portfolio or mortgage-backed securities, which are reported by firms on FR Y-

14M, Schedule A (First Lien) and FR Y-14Q, Schedule B (Securities).  Firms subject to the 

supervisory stress test typically have substantial exposure to the assets referenced in the 

mortgage spread, and as a result, by incorporating the mortgage spread into scenarios, stress tests 

help ensure that firms are prepared for a wide range of market conditions, including periods of 

elevated mortgage spreads, in part reflecting financial shocks and any associated economic 

downturn.  This helps maintain the overall stability and resilience of the financial system.   

The Board uses a quarterly average of the mortgage rate spread in the stress test 

scenarios.  Quarterly averages smooth out excessive (and potentially irrelevant) volatility that is 

present at weekly or monthly frequencies.  Using quarterly averages strikes a balance between 

being sensitive enough to capture market trends and stable enough to avoid overreaction to 

market volatility that is not representative of underlying trends in housing markets or the broader 

economy.  

In determining the appropriate level of scenario severity, the Board adheres to scenario 

design principles discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information.  While doing so, 

the Board also strives to avoid introducing additional sources of procyclicality into the financial 

system.  In the context of the mortgage spread, these principles are applied in calibrating three 

key aspects of the guide: the trough value, the timing of the trough value, and the trajectory to 

Page 191 of 294 

 
trough.  This approach helps ensure that the mortgage spread guide aligns with the established 

stress testing literature while mitigating potential systemic risks for the financial system.  

The rest of this section is organized as follows.  First, Table 21 provides an overview of 

the mortgage rate guide components, which is followed by a description of the peak component 

for the guide.  The next subsection provides the data- and scenario-based rationale for the 

calibration of the peak component.  A discussion of an alternative peak option follows in the next 

section, comparing the implementation and caveats to the proposed guide option.  Finally, 

additional guide parameters (trough value timing and trajectory to the peak) and the rationale for 

their calibration are discussed.

a. 

Peak Value Component of the Guide 

The mortgage rate is expected to move such that its spread relative to the 10-year 

Treasury yield would increase from its jump-off level (i.e., the value of the variable in the 

quarter before the start of the scenario) to a range determined by that level plus 70 basis points to 

160 basis points, with a lower bound of 300 basis points.  

Data- and Scenario-Based Rationale for the Peak Value 

In line with the guiding principles emphasized by the stress testing literature and 

discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the Board uses the behavior of the 

Page 192 of 294 

 
 
mortgage spreads during financial stress episodes, including the 2007–2009 financial crisis, to 

calibrate the guide for the mortgage spread in the supervisory stress test scenarios.  In particular, 

the Board considers the behavior of the mortgage spread in three severe recessions, including the 

2007–2009 financial crisis, to calibrate the guide for mortgage spreads in the supervisory stress 

test scenarios.  In particular, the calibration of the lower bound of 300 basis points in the guide is 

based on evidence from historical stress episodes along with the principle of conservatism.  The 

average peak value for the mortgage spread observed in severe recessions has been 278 basis 

points (Table 22), ranging from 225 to 380 basis points.226  In the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the 

peak mortgage spread measured about 249 basis points at a weekly frequency.227  The calibration 

of the lower bound of 300 basis points—a value that is slightly above the historical average 

during severe recessions—speaks to the guiding principle that adequate severity should be 

somewhat beyond historical experiences.  In addition, setting a floor for the mortgage spreads at 

300 basis points recognizes the fact that, not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial 

intermediaries during robust expansions, but that these risks are also easily obscured by a 

buoyant environment. 

226 A similar average peak value of 260 points is obtained from averaging across episodes of housing market stress, 
which include the 1973 recession along with the previously defined housing recessions (1980Q2–1985Q2, 1989Q4–
1997Q1, 2005Q4–2012Q1).  See 12 CFR 252, Appendix A.  

227 The spread measure at weekly frequency is obtained as an average over daily values starting from Thursday of 
the previous week and ending on Wednesday of the next week.  Accordingly, the value of approximately 249 basis 
points was reached in the calendar week ending on December 21, 2008.  A close value of 248 basis points was 
reached in the calendar week ending on August 31, 2008.

The historical maximum value of the mortgage spread occurred in the 1980–1985 

episode—in a high-inflation environment with high unemployment as well—and measured 404 

basis points, based on quarterly averages of the spread.  Weekly averages of the spread during 

this episode would result in a higher peak level of 541 basis points, which was reached in the 

calendar week ending on April 20, 1980 (Figure 7).  Between 2022 and 2024, inflation 

accelerated, and the mortgage spread rose above the 2007–2009 peak, reaching a quarterly-

frequency maximum of 284 basis points in 2023 Q2 (304 basis points at a weekly frequency, in 

the calendar week ending on May 28, 2023) despite a strong economy and well-functioning 

mortgage markets.  Hence, guide calibration of the mortgage spread should account for 

conditions in the housing market, including interest rate volatility, and the phase of the business

Figure 7: Mortgage Spread at Quarterly and Weekly Frequencies (in percentage points)229 

In its formulation of the annual scenarios, the Board could consider the overall level of 

cyclical systemic risk, or the current level of the mortgage spreads as a contemporaneous 

indicator of uncertainty and financial stress.  As discussed in Section IX.F of this Supplementary 

Information, the Board expects to calibrate the increment in the mortgage spreads based on its 

views of the status of cyclical systemic risk.  Specifically, the Board would be more likely to set 

the mortgage spread peak value at the higher end of the range if the Board expects that cyclical 

systemic risks are high (as it would be after a sustained long expansion), and alternatively would

be more likely to set the peak value to the lower end of the range if cyclical systemic risks are 

low (as it would be in the earlier stages of a recovery), provided doing so remained consistent 

with the goal of ensuring that firms were properly capitalized to withstand severe economic and 

financial conditions.  This might result in a scenario that is more intense than normal if the Board 

expects that cyclical systemic risks were increasing in a period of sustained robust expansion.  

Conversely, it would also allow the Board to specify a scenario that is less intense than normal in 

an environment where systemic risks appeared subdued, such as in the early stages of a 

recovery.  The lower end of the range could also be appropriate when underlying market 

uncertainty and financial stress start to recede and higher-than-usual credit losses stemming from 

previously elevated levels of mortgage spreads were either already realized or are in the process 

of being realized, and thus removed from firms’ balance sheets.  This choice would consider that 

the scenario does not add unduly to remaining stress, thereby exacerbating the initial adverse 

shock, and it would be particularly appropriate if the Board judges that firms are already taking 

steps to reduce their risk—for instance, by potentially restricting lending to otherwise qualified 

borrowers.230 

Consider the application of the range component of the guide (70 to 160 basis points 

from the jump-off value) illustrated in Figure 8 (solid lines) for 2014–2025 stress test cycles.  

This time period is illustrative as it contains various stages of the business and financial cycle 

(normalization after the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

normalization after it in a higher-inflation environment).  Accordingly, the initial conditions in 

this period are quite representative.  While the lower bound of the range (300 basis points) was 

230 Evidence of market uncertainty and financial stress receding could include stronger lending growth, an easing of 
lending standards, strong stock market performance or positive economic news related to GDP, unemployment, or 
nonfarm payroll.  Evidence that credit losses are being realized could include elevated charge-offs on loans and 
leases or loan-loss provisions in excess of gross charge-offs. 

Page 196 of 294 

 
 
explained above, the application of the upper part of the range results in values from 300 basis 

points to 440 basis points, with the higher values achieved in 2022–2024, a period of higher 

inflation.  Per the discussion above, these values, while being severe, do not deviate too far from 

historically observed values.  And consistently with historical experiences, these values also 

reflect the inflation environment. 

Figure 8: Implied Range for Mortgage Spreads, Peak Values of Mortgage Spreads in Past 
Scenarios, Historical Data on Mortgage Spreads (in basis points)231 

To illustrate the implications of the guide, the Board applies it to recent historical data 

and compares the implied peak prescriptions with the corresponding peaks from past stress test 

scenarios (Figure 8).  From 2013Q1 until 2019Q4, the stress test peak values, depicted by the 

dots, were quantitatively close to the upper end of the range of the proposed guide, depicted by 

the solid lines (Figure 8).  From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 through 2021, the 

231 Data derived from Primary Mortgage Market Survey of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and 
Federal Reserve staff estimates. 

Page 197 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
stress test peaks were mostly within the bands of the proposed guide, while in 2022–2024 the 

stress test peaks were located at or very close to the lower end of the range suggested by the 

proposed guide.  Summing up, comparison of the guide-implied peaks with the past stress test 

peak values shows that the guide is broadly consistent with past scenario values.  The range of 

the guide should allow the Board to account for risks that are apparent in relevant indicators of 

economic and financial conditions and constrain the peak to historically plausible bounds during 

normal periods, while adjusting to future periods in which spreads may move toward record 

levels. 

Alternative Peak Guide Option 

As an alternative, the Board also considered a guide that would choose a peak level as a 

maximum between 300 basis points and an increase from the jump-off value by 100 basis points.  

A comparison of the alternative and the proposed guides in 2013–2024 illustrates episodes when 

the alternative guide deviates from the proposed guide.  As the alternative guide has a flat 

increment regardless of the underlying conditions, it would propose systematically lower peak 

values in the pre-pandemic period and systematically higher values in the post-pandemic period, 

when compared with the stress test peaks.  Additionally, following this alternative guide would 

not allow the Board to respond to risks not already reflected in the current level of the mortgage 

spread.  

Although the proposed and the alternative guides are both discussed, and the Board views 

the alternative guide as reasonable, the benefits to the public from increased predictability in the 

alternative guide are considered to be outweighed by the added flexibility to reflect risks related 

to mortgage finance that are apparent in relevant indicators of economic and financial conditions 

or to avoid adding additional sources of procyclicality in the proposed guide.  The purpose of the 

Page 198 of 294 

 
alternative guide discussion is to invite comment on a reasonable alternative considered by the 

Board and to transparently lay out the Board’s present decision making in choosing the proposed 

guide.  

b. 

Additional Guide Parameters and Rationale Behind Them 

Peak Value Timing 

In general, the entire 13-quarter trajectory of stress test variables is important as it 

ultimately affects implied firm losses.  The value of the peak and its timing signify the 

magnitude and timing of the most severe point in this trajectory.  The proposed guide stipulates 

that the peak level in the scenario would be reached in quarters 3 to 4, which is consistent with 

historical observations and past severely adverse scenarios (Table 22).  The proposed guide sets 

a range of peak timings between 3 and 4 quarters, whereas the alternative guide eliminates this 

flexibility and stipulates a peak in quarter 3.  Keeping the magnitude of the peak constant, a more 

delayed peak timing generally results in less severity of the overall path, as a less abrupt 

worsening in conditions and credit quality gives firms and mortgage borrowers more time to 

adjust to the shock.  In contrast, an earlier peak timing would increase the scenario severity. 

For the proposed guide, a range in the timing (quarter 3 or quarter 4) is used as an 

additional lever (together with the peak magnitude range) to avoid adding sources of 

procyclicality in the stress test.  An earlier peak timing would increase the scenario severity.  The 

factors that the Board would consider in setting the timing of the peak are the same as those 

discussed above influencing the level of the peak. 

Trajectory to Peak Value 

To reach the peak spread value, the guide prescribes that the highest share of the spread 

increase (50 to 70 percent) occurs in the first quarter of the scenario.  After quarter one and until 

Page 199 of 294 

 
the peak is reached, the guide stipulates a smooth trajectory.  Such frontloading of the spread 

increase is consistent with the historical evidence and academic literature.232  Averaging across 

all financial stress episodes, the share of the mortgage spread increase that occurs in the first 

quarter after the onset of the stress is about 60 percent; in other words, 60 percent of the distance 

from the jump-off point to the peak is covered in the first quarter.  This number is quantitatively 

similar to the past stress test scenarios in 2013–2025, where on average the corresponding share 

measures 64 percent.  Averaging across severe historical episodes in the data yields a share of 73 

percent.  At the same time, there are severe episodes with a somewhat smaller increase in the 

share occurring in the first quarter.  For instance, the severe episode surrounding the 1981 

recession measured 47 percent of the mortgage spread increase in the first quarter.  Hence, both 

the guide calibration (over 50 percent) as well as the average obtained across the mortgage 

spread paths in 2013–2025 stress test scenarios (64 percent) lie within historically plausible 

bounds. 

International Variables  

As described in the Scenario Design Policy Statement, a scenario that targets all specific 

risk factor groups includes judgement on the projected paths of selected international variables.  

Recessions that occur simultaneously across countries are an important source of stress to the 

balance sheets of firms with notable international exposures but are not a typical feature of the 

international economy even when the United States is in recession.  As a result, simply adopting 

the typical path of international variables in a severe U.S. recession would likely underestimate 

the risks stemming from the international economy.  Consequently, an approach that relies on 

both judgement and insights from economic models informs the path of international variables.  

232 See supra note 222. 

Page 200 of 294 

 
 
As part of the review of the scenario design framework, the Board has developed simple 

quantitative guides for the proposed paths of the international variables used in the severely 

adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test.  Consistent with the Scenario Design Policy 

Statement, the international component of the stress test scenarios contains the path for real 

GDP, consumer price inflation, and the nominal exchange rate for four country blocs: the euro 

area, the U.K., Japan, and Developing Asia.233  These economies capture the majority of the 

foreign exposure of U.S. banks.  

The following guides apply to each international variable: 

•  A peak/trough value, which represents the extreme value (either peak or trough, 

depending on the variable) that is typically reached in the severely adverse scenario.  For 

all variables the peak/trough is reached after 4 quarters. 

•  An end value for the last period in the scenario, that is 13 quarters after initial impact. 

•  A scenario path, which describes the path of international variables from the jump-off 

value to the peak/trough value and then to the end value. 

•  A scenario range, which specifies by how much each variable can deviate from the 

scenario path to adapt to relevant changes in banking, macroeconomic, or other 

conditions.  

a. 

Overview of Approach  

In designing the paths of the international variables in the severely adverse scenario, the 

Board opted to follow a prescriptive approach that is informed by the experience of the 2007–

233 For the purpose of the supervisory stress tests, the Board defines Developing Asia as China, India, Hong Kong, 
South Korea, and Taiwan.  Aggregate variables for this bloc (GDP, inflation, and the nominal exchange rate) are 
obtained by weighting country-specific variables by their relative share of the total nominal GDP (expressed in U.S. 
dollars).

2009 financial crisis.  Given its global repercussions, the 2007–2009 financial crisis is a useful 

benchmark for the economic effects of a large global financial shock.  

To generate the proposed paths of GDP and inflation in the four economic regions for the 

severely adverse scenario, the Board first computed the distance between the realized outcomes 

of GDP and inflation during the 2007–2009 financial crisis from the baseline forecasts prior to 

the onset of the 2007–2009 financial crisis.  These baseline forecasts were derived from publicly 

available forecasts from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators and the IMF World Economic 

Outlook (WEO).234  The Blue Chip and WEO forecasts provide values for year-over-year real 

GDP growth and inflation.  To forecast quarterly GDP growth rates and inflation rates, quarterly 

values are first derived from the annual growth rates using linear interpolation; then a Hodrick-

Prescott filter is used to smooth the path of GDP and inflation across the forecast period.235  

Based on this procedure, the Board specifies guides for the values of the variables of interest.  

These values are usually reached in the scenario, but the Board reserves the right to depart from 

these values within specified ranges.   

The data for the euro area, the U.K., and Japan were aggregated to obtain identical guides 

for GDP and inflation for these Advanced Foreign Economies (AFEs).  The Board favored 

identical guides for these regions to prevent possible credit allocation incentives that could arise 

if guides differed systematically between the AFEs.  However, identical guides do not imply that 

234 The Blue Chip data provide forecasts over a two-year horizon and are updated at a monthly frequency. The  
WEO data provide forecasts over a six-year horizon, which are updated biannually in April and September/October 
each year.  To produce the baseline scenario, the Blue Chip forecasts are used for the first two years, whereas the 
WEO forecasts are used for the remaining years. 

235 The Hodrick-Prescott filter is an empirical tool that can be employed to remove the cyclical component of a time 
series data.  This technique was developed by Whittaker (1923) and popularized in economics by Hodrick and 
Prescott (1997).  See E. Whittaker, “On a New Method of Graduation.” Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical 
Association. 41: 63–75 (1923), https://doi.org/10.1017%2FS0013091500077853; R. Hodrick & E. Prescott, Postwar

the actual severely adverse scenario features identical paths for the euro area, the U.K., and 

Japan.  The scenario paths of the three regions can vary with the given ranges.  

The key elements of the international guides derived from this procedure are summarized 

in Table 23; Figure 9 shows the behavior of the variables of interest during the 2007–2009 

financial crisis from which the guides are derived.  Detailed explanations and alternative 

considerations are provided thereafter.  For GDP, the deviation is computed as percentage 

change from the baseline real GDP level.  For inflation, the deviation is computed as percentage 

point difference from the baseline path of inflation.  For exchange rates, the guide is expressed in 

terms of percent deviation from the jump-off point.

Table 23 also provides ranges for each variable to allow for flexibility:  This flexibility 

enables judgment to be exercised to capture the possibility that the foreign economies might 

react differently to financial stress, either because of changes in the global macroeconomic 

landscape or in country-specific vulnerabilities. 

Page 203 of 294 

 
 
 
The prescriptive approach for the international variables in the severely adverse scenario 

yields guides that are qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable based on the Board’s judgment 

and broadly accepted models of international economies.236  The Board opted for the more 

prescriptive approach because the advantages of increased transparency and simplicity 

outweighed the disadvantage of less flexibility.   

b. 

GDP 

Trough Value 

The magnitude of the prescribed economic downturn in the specified foreign economies 

is informed by the deterioration in foreign economic activity which occurred between 2008Q1 

and 2009Q1.  In particular, the trough value for GDP is obtained by considering the deviation of 

the real GDP level in 2009Q1 from a baseline path derived from the April 2008 IMF WEO 

forecast.237  This approach implies that, four quarters after jump-off, the GDP levels in the euro 

area, the U.K., and Japan are 7.5 percent below the baseline scenario.238  In Developing Asia, 

GDP growth declines until GDP reaches a level 3 percent below baseline. These values are in 

line with the behavior of real GDP reported in the top panel of Figure 9. 

End Value  

In the euro area, the U.K., and Japan, the level of GDP at the end of the severely adverse 

scenario deviates from the corresponding value in the baseline (13 quarters after initial impact) 

236 See, e.g., M. Adrian et al., A quantitative model for the integrated policy framework. IMF WP/20/122 (2020).    
237 The April 2008 WEO provides forecasts for annual GDP growth and for annual inflation between 2008 and 2013. 
Blue Chip forecast for international variables are not available until 2009.  The baseline for quarterly GDP growth 
rates and inflation, over the period 2008Q2 until 2011Q2, is generated using the same procedure employed to create 
the baseline scenario: first, quarterly values for the GDP level are obtained by linearly interpolating the annual 
growth rates available in the WEO forecast, and then a Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to smooth the GDP level path 
across the forecast period. 

238 This value is in line with the average deviation from baseline across these advanced economies in 2009Q1, when 
weighting the deviations from baseline by the nominal GDP (in U.S. dollars) in each country bloc in 2007. 

Page 204 of 294 

 
 
by the same magnitude as the trough value of GDP deviates from the corresponding value in the 

baseline (4 quarters after initial impact).  This assumption implies that, in line with the 

experience of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, after reaching the trough, GDP in the AFEs 

grows at the same rate as in the (pre-crisis) baseline.  The guide proposes that GDP recovers 

more quickly in developing Asia, returning to the GDP baseline in levels at the end of the 

scenario, in line with the evidence from 2011Q2.  These GDP paths are consistent with Figure 9 

and with empirical evidence which suggests that advanced economies suffer very persistent 

output losses following a financial crisis, while developing economies experience less severe 

slowdowns.239  

Path 

Real GDP reaches the reference trough four quarters after the jump-off date and then 

gradually converges to the end value of the scenario.  After reaching the trough, the AFEs 

experience a similar GDP growth rate in the scenario as in the baseline, whereas Developing 

Asia grows faster in the scenario to catch up with the level of GDP in the baseline.  The path of 

GDP is created with a two-step procedure similar to the one used to generate the baseline 

scenario.  First, the series is linearly interpolated between the jump-off value and the trough 

value and from the trough value to the end value.  Then, a Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to 

smooth the GDP path over the duration of the scenario.  This approach generates a smooth path 

for GDP consistent with business cycle dynamics.

Range 

The path described above captures the GDP dynamics during the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis.  In determining the magnitude of the international shock in the severely adverse scenario, 

the Board would consider several factors, including the current economic performance of foreign 

economies, the risks posed by country-specific vulnerabilities, and the scope for countercyclical 

policy actions in each country bloc.  For example, in periods of sub-par foreign economic 

performance, the Board would likely reduce the magnitude of the shock, whereas when foreign 

growth is particularly strong, the magnitude of the shock would be increased.  In addition, the 

allocation of shocks across blocs can be altered to highlight relevant country-specific risks.  This 

strategy is implemented by increasing or decreasing the severity of the shock, as measured by the 

deviation of GDP from baseline at the scenario trough, by at most 2.5 percent.240  As a result, at 

the trough, real GDP can fall between 5 and 10 percent below the baseline in advanced foreign 

economies, bracketing the real GDP outcomes of the three AFEs in the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis.  For Developing Asia, real GDP can fall between 0.5 and 5.5 percent below the baseline. 

These adjustments are performed while keeping the overall stress on foreign economies, as 

measured by the average GDP deviation from baseline at the trough, within a range of 4 to 9 

percent.241 

240 This value is in line with the average standard deviation of four-quarter GDP growth across the four country 
blocs, computed over the pre-COVID-19 historical sample.  When adjusting the reference peak/trough value, the 
reference end value is adjusted proportionally, to keep the ratio with the trough value constant. 

241 Total effect on the foreign economies is computed weighting the deviations from baseline in each country bloc by 
the bloc’s nominal GDP (in U.S. dollars) in the year preceding the jump-off date.  The range of -4 to -9 percent is 
centered around -6.5 percent—that is, the average deviation from baseline across the foreign economies in 2009Q1.

Inflation 

Trough Value 

Inflation is assumed to decline below the baseline scenario for the first four quarters of 

the simulation, consistent with the demand-driven decline in GDP growth over the same period.  

This behavior is broadly in line with the historical evidence between 2008Q1 and 2009Q1 for the 

four country blocs.  The maximum decline in inflation is calibrated to reflect the difference 

between the realized rate of inflation and the one derived from the April 2008 IMF WEO 

forecast for 2009Q1 (middle panel of Figure 9Figure ).  This method provides that, four quarters 

after the jump-off date, inflation is below baseline by about 3 percentage points in the euro area, 

the UK, and in Japan, and by 5 percentage points in Developing Asia.242   

End Value 

After reaching the trough, inflation gradually returns to baseline by the 13th quarter of 

the simulation.  This inflation path is consistent with the evidence from the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis, when inflation returned to, or even surpassed, the WEO baseline by 2011.  In addition, 

academic research suggests that financial crises typically do not have large or persistent effects 

on inflation.243 

Path 

The path for inflation is obtained by using the same strategy employed for GDP, which 

combines linear interpolation and a Hodrick-Prescott filter. 

242 The decline in inflation in the Euro area, UK, and Japan is in line with the average deviation from baseline across 
these advanced economies in 2009Q1, when weighting the deviations from baseline by the nominal GDP (in U.S. 
dollars) in each country bloc in 2007. 

243 See, e.g., M. Schularick & A. Taylor, Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles, and 
Financial Crises, 1870–2008, 102 AM. ECON. REV. 1029–61 (2012); S. Gilchrist et al., Inflation Dynamics during 
the Financial Crisis, 107 AM. ECON. REV. 785–823 (2017). 

Page 208 of 294 

 
 
Range 

If the path of GDP is different from the reference path, the path for inflation will be 

adjusted to preserve the same ratio between the deviation of GDP and the deviation of inflation 

from baseline under the reference path—the values of these ratios are 2.5 for advanced foreign 

economies and 0.6 for Developing Asia.244  As a result, inflation declines between 2 percentage 

points and 4 percentage points below baseline in the advanced foreign economies, and between 

0.8 percentage points and 9 percentage points below baseline in Developing Asia.  

d. 

Exchange Rates 

Trough/Peak Value   

The Board assumes that over the first four quarters of the simulation the U.S. Dollar 

experiences a 15 percent appreciation against the Euro and the British Pound.  This appreciation 

is in line with the change in the Nominal Advanced Foreign Economies U.S. Dollar Index 

between 2008Q1 and 2009Q1 (bottom left panel of Figure 9Figure ).245  Over the same period, 

the U.S. Dollar appreciates by 15 percent also against the exchange rate for Developing Asia, in 

line with the fluctuation in the Nominal Emerging Market Economies U.S. Dollar Index between 

2008Q1 and 2009Q1 (see bottom right panel of Figure 9).246  Consistent with the evidence 

between 2008Q1 and 2009Q1, the U.S. Dollar experiences a mild 1 percent depreciation against 

244 This value is equal to the ratio between the deviation of real GDP from baseline and the deviation of inflation 
from baseline at the trough in the international guides, that is the ratio between 7.5% and 3% for advanced foreign 
economies and the ratio between 3 percent and 5 percent for Developing Asia.

the Japanese Yen, which is typically considered a safe-haven currency, a currency which retains 

its value during times of global economic stress.247  

End Value 

Exchange rates gradually reach their peak/trough and then revert back to their jump-off 

values by the end of the scenario horizon.  

Path 

The path for the exchange rate is obtained by using the same strategy employed for GDP 

and inflation, which combines linear interpolation and a Hodrick-Prescott filter. 

Range 

For exchange rates, which are highly volatile and only weakly linked to macroeconomic 

fundamentals, the Board can adjust the maximum fluctuation of each of the four foreign 

currencies within a range of plus or minus 10 percent from the reference peak/trough value.248  

For each country bloc, the magnitude of the depreciation is adjusted depending on the realized 

change in the exchange rate in the year preceding the jump-off date.  For example, if over the 

past year the dollar has already appreciated by 5 percent against the euro, the Board would lower 

the appreciation rate in the scenario from 15 percent to 10 percent. 

e. 

Alternative Considerations 

The Board considered a range of different approaches to derive the guides for the 

international variables in the severely adverse scenario.  First, distinct instead of common guides 

for GDP and inflation for each of the AFEs were explored.  Following the methodology 

247 See, e.g., M. Botman, et al., The Curious Case of the Yen as a Safe Haven Currency: A Forensic Analysis, 
International Monetary Fund, WP/13/228 (2013).  The Yen/USD exchange rate went from approximately 99.9 at the 
end of 2008Q1 to 99.15 at the end of 2009Q1, a decline of about one percent. 

248 This value is in line with the average standard deviation of 4-quarter changes in the exchange rates of the four 
country blocs, computed over the pre-COVID-19 historical sample. 

Page 210 of 294 

 
 
explained in Section IX.F of this Supplementary Information, the trough values for GDP during 

the 2007–2009 financial crisis were 6 percent below baseline in both the euro area and the U.K., 

and 10 percent below baseline in Japan.  For inflation, the trough values in the 2007–2009 

financial crisis were 3 percent below baseline in the euro area, 2 percent below baseline in the 

U.K., and 4.5 percent below baseline in Japan.  The Board decided against using region-specific 

guides for the AFEs, as systematic differences in the guides across regions could affect credit 

allocations.  However, the issued guides still allow for region-specific paths in the severely 

adverse scenario within the specified ranges to reflect region-specific circumstances when 

desirable.  The Board may also use the specified ranges to raise or lower the sensitivity of all 

regions at the same time in the severely adverse scenario. 

Second, the Board examined other global or regional economic downturns of significance 

in addition to the 2007–2009 financial crisis to refine its guides for the international variables of 

the adverse scenario.  There are only a few global recessions in recent history but none of 

them—besides the 2007–2009 crisis—were driven by financial factors.  The COVID-19 

recession of 2020 led to a sharper contraction in global economic activity than the 2007–2009 

financial crisis but did not result in persistent financial stress.  One distinct feature of the 2007–

2009 financial crisis was the resilience of Developing Asia where GDP dropped by only 3 

percent relative to baseline.  Only a decade prior to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, several 

countries in Developing Asia had experienced negative doubled-digit GDP growth rates as part 

of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.  Based on the experience of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, 

the Board considered a lower trough value for Developing Asia.  However, the Board decided 

against this approach for several reasons.  China was generally unaffected by the Asian Financial 

Crisis and maintained its high GDP growth rate throughout the crisis, significantly increasing the 

Page 211 of 294 

 
regional GDP growth rate during this period despite the sharp declines experienced elsewhere in 

the region.  In addition, the countries that were most affected by the Asian Financial Crisis 

changed to more robust economic policies—switching from fixed/managed exchange rates to 

flexible inflation targeting and from policies that implied large current account deficits to 

policies that led to surpluses.  Finally, the Board looked to the euro area debt crisis for additional 

guidance.  But since this crisis directly followed the 2007–2009 financial crisis no additional 

insight for the design of the severely adverse scenario was obtained that was not already 

embedded in the analysis of the 2007–2009 financial crisis.  In the interest of transparency and 

simplicity, the Board decided to adopt the findings derived solely from the 2007–2009 financial 

crisis but added flexibility by allowing ranges for variables.   

H.  Global Market Shock  

Design of the Global Market Shock  

The global market shock component comprises a large set of financial risk factors and 

associated hypothetical shocks to those risk factors.  The Board considers emerging and ongoing 

areas of financial market vulnerabilities in the development of the global market shock 

component, informed by financial stability reports, supervisory information, and internal and 

external assessments of potential sources of distress such as geopolitical, economic, and financial 

market events.  Financial risk factor shocks are calibrated based on assumed time horizons that 

reflect several scenario design considerations.  The Board also considers liquidity characteristics 

of the different asset classes that constitute certain risk factors.  These liquidity horizons 

approximate the variation in speed at which banks could reasonably close out, or effectively 

hedge, the associated risk exposures in the event of market stress.  

Page 212 of 294 

 
The chosen risk factors of the global market shock scenario are important to specifying 

how a stress scenario unfolds across financial markets and capturing salient risks within the 

banking system.  These include, but are not limited to:  

•  Public equity returns from key advanced economies and from developing and emerging 

market economies, along with selected points along term structures of equity option-

implied volatilities;  

•  Exchange rates of foreign currencies, along with selected points along term structures of 

foreign exchange option-implied volatilities;  

•  Government yields at selected maturities (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasuries), swap rates, and 

other types of interest rates for key advanced economies and from developing and 

emerging market economies; 

• 

Implied volatilities on interest rate options for selected maturities and expiration dates, 

which are key inputs to the pricing of interest rate derivatives; 

•  Futures prices at various expiration dates for commodity products such as energy, oil, 

metals, and agricultural products; and  

•  Credit spreads or prices for selected credit-sensitive products, including corporate bonds, 

credit default swaps (CDS), securitized products, sovereign debt, and municipal bonds. 

The global market shock is typically applied to positions held by the firms on a given as-

of date, reflecting a hypothetical instantaneous “shock” to a large number of risk factors that 

determine the mark-to-market values of trading positions.  Additionally, the global market shock 

in a given annual severely adverse scenario is a standardized set of market shocks that apply to 

all of the firms with significant trading activities.  The selection of a single date, and a single 

Page 213 of 294 

 
global market shock, has tended to enhance the operational consistency and simplicity of the 

annual supervisory stress test, while managing burden on reporting firms. 

The Board is considering enhancements to the design of the global market shock in the 

annual stress test to improve the stress test’s ability to capture the impact of severe economic 

stress in financial markets.  Alternative approaches to the global market shock could include 

employing instantaneous shock events across multiple as-of dates, rather than the current 

approach of selecting a single date for an instantaneous shock event.  Another approach could 

involve an annual stress test that features multiple global market shock components on a single 

as-of date, which would allow the Board to compare a given firm’s losses across a variety of 

types of shocks for a given set of trading position.  The set of losses generated by such multiple 

market scenarios could be aggregated using a simple average, an average of the two worst 

outcomes, or another technique.  These alternatives could enhance the dynamism of the annual 

stress tests and improve the Board’s ability to evaluate the impact of severe economic stress on 

trading positions in a given annual stress test.  However, these changes could also increase the 

complexity of the tests, and affect their predictability from year to year.   

Question 44: What changes could the Board implement to improve the general design of the 

global market shock?  What, if any, alternative approaches should the Board consider?  

For instance, should the Board consider adjusting the global market shock so that shock 

events occur on multiple dates within the as-of date window?  Should the Board consider 

testing more than one global market shock component in a given annual stress test or on 

a particular date?  If so, how should the Board assess whether the current design, or 

alternative approaches, contribute to outcomes that are overly volatile or insufficiently 

representative of risks?  If the Board should adopt these alternative approaches, what 

Page 214 of 294 

 
information should the Board provide to the public about how it will implement these 

alternatives, and should that information be published as part of a revised Scenario 

Design Policy Statement, codified as part of Regulation YY, the annual scenario 

disclosure, or some other means?   

Question 45: If the Board did adjust the global market shock to consider multiple dates 

within the as-of date window or more than one global market shock component in a given 

annual stress test or on a particular date, what method should the Board use to 

aggregate these values to calculate a firm’s trading and counterparty losses in the stress 

test and why?  For example, should the Board consider averaging the two instances of 

highest trading and counterparty losses?  What would be the advantages and 

disadvantages of these aggregation methods? 

Question 46: The global market shock component and the largest counterparty default 

component of the severely adverse scenario are both based on the global market shock.  

Should the Board consider removing one or both of these components from the severely 

adverse scenario?  If so, what alternative approaches should the Board consider to 

account for trading and counterparty losses in the supervisory stress test?  For example, 

should trading and counterparty losses be considered as part of the macroeconomic 

scenario as opposed to the global market shock?  What would be the advantages and 

disadvantages of retaining these components or replacing them with alternative 

approaches?  

Question 47: Should the Board continue to include a global market shock component in the 

severely adverse scenario?  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of 

including a market shock component in the severely adverse scenario?  If the Board 

Page 215 of 294 

 
determines to remove the market shock component, are there additional changes that the 

Board should implement that would mitigate any disadvantages from this change?  

Question 48: The global market shock component currently applies to firms subject to 

Category I, II, and III standards that have aggregate trading assets and liabilities of $50 

billion or more, or trading assets and liabilities equal to or greater than 10 percent of 

total consolidated assets.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the 

global market shock component to this group of firms?  Should this component apply to a 

different set or subset of firms?  If so, how should the Board determine which set or 

subset of firms should be subject to the global market shock component? 

Shock Values  

The Board generates shock values for all exposures in the global market shock template.  

Shock values represent the magnitudes of changes to the financial risk factors and reflect the 

severity of market stress that these risk factors experience in the scenario.  Table 24 provides an 

overview of the proposed shock definitions by asset class.

Liquidity Horizons 

Financial risk factor shocks are calibrated based on assumed time horizons that reflect 

several scenario design considerations.  The horizons are generally longer than the typical times 

needed to liquidate exposures under normal conditions because they are designed to capture the 

unpredictable liquidity conditions that prevail in times of stress.  The Board is proposing to add 

descriptions of the liquidity horizons in the Scenario Design Policy Statement. 

As discussed below, the Board is proposing horizons that are intended to maintain 

consistency with the timeline for attributing losses stemming from these risk factors.  

Specifically, losses associated with the global market shock component are recognized in the first 

Page 218 of 294 

 
 
 
quarter of the projection horizon, which indicates that these shocks occur within a three-month 

period and thus implies a three-month upper bound for calibrating the shocks.  

The Board is proposing to amend its Scenario Design Policy Statement to use shock 

liquidity horizons that are broadly consistent with the proposed standards in the Basel Committee 

on Banking Supervision’s Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB).249  The risk factors 

in the FRTB are similar to the ones in global market shock.  The horizons in the FRTB were 

determined by the Basel Committee in consultations with the financial industry and represent the 

general consensus of a broad range of regulation authorities and the industry.  Therefore, they are 

a reasonable benchmark for defining the shock horizons used in the global market shock.  The 

Board departed from the FRTB slightly by specifying the same liquidity horizon to all risk 

factors in the same asset class.  This choice was consistent with the Board’s stress test principle 

of simplicity and facilitated a more straightforward modeling framework for the global market 

shock. 

The liquidity horizons used in the global market shock component are not perfectly 

matched with the FRTB liquidity horizons due to granularity differences between the FRTB 

standards and the global market shock template.  The FRTB specifies horizons at a more granular 

level, often using different horizons within each asset class.  For example, the FRTB specifies 

sovereign risk factor horizons by credit rating.  In contrast, the global market shock template 

specifies sovereign shocks by country to capture country-specific risks not reflected by credit 

ratings.  Moreover, the Board uses the same liquidity horizon for all risk factors within each asset 

class, whereas the FRTB allows for different horizons within asset classes.  Given these 

249  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Calculation of RWA for market risk,” in The Basel Framework 
675–970, https://www.bis.org/baselframework/BaselFramework.pdf.  See also 88 FR 64028, 64138 (Sep. 18, 2023). 

Page 219 of 294 

 
 
differences, the global market shock scenario aims at aligning with the horizons specified by the 

FRTB by using a weighted average of the FRTB horizons within each asset class.  The weights 

are determined using aggregate firm exposures over past submission quarters.  For example, 

FRTB horizons for equity risk factors vary between 10 and 60 business days, and the global 

market shock horizon for this asset class would be four weeks.  Because the Board imposes an 

upper bound on global market shock horizons of one quarter, there are cases where the range of 

FRTB horizons would be longer than the global market shock horizon.  For example, FRTB 

horizons for corporate credit risk factors vary between 60 and 120 business days, but the Board 

uses a horizon of three months for corporate credit.  See Table 25.

Board consider?  

Global Market Shock Simplification 

As discussed in Section II.B of this Supplementary Information, the global market shock 

specifies hypothetical shocks to a standard set of risk factors.  Currently, the global market shock 

discloses more than 20,000 risk factors that reflect sudden market distress and heightened 

Page 221 of 294 

 
 
uncertainty.  Statistical models are used to generate a subset of risk factors out of these 20,000 

risk factors with the remaining ones generated by simple mapping.  However, this latter category 

includes many risk factors that are often not material (for example, certain commodity shocks).  

These low-materiality exposures do not necessarily enhance the risk capture of the global market 

shock component. 

To address these issues and simplify the global market shock component, the Board is 

proposing to substantially reduce the number of disclosed risk factors.  Specifically, this would 

reduce the number of disclosed risk factors to approximately 2,300 shocks, determined based on 

their relevance for developing a global market shock scenario narrative, the materiality of the 

risk factor, data quality, and consistency across asset classes.   

Under this approach, the Board would also review consistency across asset classes.  In 

this regard, where possible, the Board would generate shocks to the same set of countries, 

regions, and tenor points across different asset classes.  Such consistency would simplify shock 

comparison across different asset classes and improve public understanding of the global market 

shock component.  Additionally, the Board is proposing to remove the inclusion of shocks to the 

values of private equity positions in section 3.2(b)(viii) of the Scenario Design Policy Statement, 

because private equity exposures are now stressed using the severely adverse macroeconomic 

scenario. 

Question 50: What are the advantages and disadvantages of simplifying the global market 

shock’s specification of risk factor shocks?  What are the advantages and disadvantages 

of removing shocks related to the value of private equity positions from the global market 

shock component?

Economic Analysis  

Introduction  

In December 2024, the Board announced that it would seek public comment on 

significant changes to improve the transparency of its supervisory stress test and to reduce the 

volatility of resulting capital buffer requirements.250  As discussed in Section II.E of this 

Supplementary Information, this proposal would improve the transparency and public 

accountability surrounding the stress test models and scenarios, as well as make certain changes 

to their underlying methodologies, which could provide meaningful benefits to the public as 

discussed below.  This section provides economic analysis of the enhanced disclosure of the 

supervisory stress test framework. 

The Board’s supervisory stress test has historically operated with some disclosure 

regarding the stress test models and scenarios used, with an increase in public information 

provided beginning in 2019, as discussed in Section II.B of this Supplementary Information.  

The comprehensive model documentation that the Board is publishing on its website, as well as 

the proposed enhanced disclosure process for the models and scenarios, provides several 

benefits, including improved credibility of the stress test, improvement in feedback regarding the 

modeling process, better informed investors, and improved market discipline.  However, the 

enhanced disclosure comes with costs as well, including reduced model dynamism, and 

increased systemic reliance on a single model, that is, “model monoculture.”  

250 See Board, Press Release (Dec. 23, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/
bcreg20241223a.htm.  In February 2025, the Board stated that it would begin the public comment process on 
comprehensive changes to the supervisory stress test in 2025.  See Board, Press Release (Feb. 5, 2025), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250205a.htm.

Baseline  

The economic analysis uses the current stress testing framework, including the current 

disclosure regime, as the baseline.  Throughout the analysis, the Board assesses the economic 

impact of the proposal by comparing outcomes under the proposal to the outcomes estimated 

under the baseline.   

Proposed Policy Changes  

With this proposal, the Board is providing a comprehensive description of the modeling 

framework used to conduct the supervisory stress test: the equations, variables and parameters of 

each model used to estimate the projections that, when aggregated, produce the results of the 

supervisory stress test.  This proposal would also codify an enhanced disclosure process under 

which the Board would annually publish the stress test models, invite public comment on any 

material changes to the models, and seek comment on the annual stress test scenarios.  This 

represents a significant increase in disclosure relative to present, as current stress test disclosures 

are more limited, for example, current disclosures cover the structure of the stress testing model 

framework and key variables, along with hypothetical portfolio loss rates for select corporate and 

retail loss models.   

In addition, this proposal would change the stress test jump-off date and the GMS as-of 

date, as described in Sections VI.A and VI.B of this Supplementary Information.  These changes 

would adjust the stress testing schedule to accommodate the public comment process and 

mitigate risks that the enhanced disclosure provided under this proposal would undermine the 

goals of supervisory stress testing.  

Section VIII.A of this Supplementary Information summarizes proposed changes to the 

stress testing models from the 2025 to the 2026 supervisory stress test, which would inform the 

Page 224 of 294 

 
Board’s determination of firms’ stress capital buffer requirements.251  Section VIII.B provides an 

analysis of the potential effects of these proposed model changes.   

Finally, Sections V and IX of this Supplementary Information describe proposed changes 

to the Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement and Scenario Design Policy Statement.  The 

proposed changes to the Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement and Scenario Design Policy 

Statement are intended to express the Board’s expectations for how the Board conducts the 

annual supervisory stress test and designs annual scenarios for the annual supervisory stress test.  

These changes provide additional transparency, public accountability, and predictability without 

creating binding legal obligations or economic impact. 

Analysis of Benefits and Costs of Enhanced Model Disclosure  

Benefits 

a. 

Improved credibility of the stress test  

The supervisory stress test has material safety and soundness benefits and these benefits 

are likely more sustainable when the Board’s stress testing program operates with high levels of 

accountability and credibility.  Disclosing comprehensive model documentation to the public 

ensures that all institutions and stakeholders have equal access to the supervisory methodology, 

which could improve accountability in supervisory decision-making, promote fairness, and 

reinforce trust in the stress testing process.  Publicly disclosing the stress test models and 

scenarios also enhances trust in the stress testing process,252 as stakeholders may be able to better 

251  For a more detailed discussion of the proposed model changes, see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm.

positive impact on trust, see M. Cucciniello et al., 25 Years of Transparency Research: Evidence and Future 
Directions, 77 PUBLIC ADMIN. REV. 32–44 (2016).

assess the soundness of models and their alignment with best practices.253  As a result, firms may 

understand better where there are discrepancies between their own internal stress testing models 

and the supervisory stress testing models, and consequently they may be better positioned to 

communicate specific concerns with supervisors.  With greater transparency and public 

accountability, stakeholders may be more confident that the supervisory stress test results do not 

reflect the desires of firms or supervisors to obtain a specific outcome.254  While the Board has 

previously released enhanced disclosures of the stress test models, such as portfolio-level 

average loss rates, macro-to-loss linkages, and risk drivers, the comprehensive model 

documentation disclosed in connection with this proposal better illustrates how supervisors 

incorporate model refinements and emerging risks, which could further improve credibility over 

time.   

In addition, as described in Section VI.B of this Supplementary Information, this 

proposal would extend the date selection range of GMS as-of date from five months (between 

October 1 of the previous year and March 1 of a given year) to a full year (between October 1 of 

two years prior to a given stress test cycle to October 1 of the year prior to a given stress test 

cycle).  Thus, the GMS could be applied to market risk positions held by the firms on any 

selected date within the full year instead of the current five months.  This change could reduce 

firm’s risk gaming activities such as “window dressing” for firms subject to the GMS.

away, 158 JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE 107042 (2024).  When regulators are more constrained in their ability 
to make the models more or less severe, this could alleviate inefficient strategic interactions between supervisors and 
banks, referred to as “policy traps.” J. Shapiro & J. Zeng, Stress Testing and Bank Lending, 37 REV. OF FIN. STUDIES 
1265–1314 (2024). 

Page 226 of 294 

 
 
Therefore, the resulting improved risk capture would further enhance the credibility of the stress 

test results.  

b. 

Improved model feedback   

The Board’s supervisory stress test models consist of equations, parameters, and 

assumptions that translate hypothetical macroeconomic shocks under designed stress scenarios 

into loss estimates across asset classes, income streams, and capital ratios.  Despite their 

complexity, the supervisory stress test models and stress scenarios, like all theoretical models, 

remain simplified representations of reality.  As such, they benefit from feedback and 

refinement.  Public disclosure of models and scenarios should provide academics, industry 

professionals, and the broader risk community with the information to provide more effective 

feedback.255  For example, in past supervisory stress testing cycles, stakeholders have raised 

concerns about loss rates on certain asset classes.  Over time, such feedback could help to refine 

and improve the models and scenarios as they could be updated to mitigate concerns, as 

appropriate.  In this sense, the proposal’s enhanced disclosure could facilitate stakeholders’ 

feedback, ultimately leading to better modelling performance and further enhancing the 

credibility of the supervisory stress testing process.256   

c. 

Improved Ability to Evaluate Business Plans 

Comprehensive disclosure of the stress test models also may help firms better understand 

how supervisors assess losses under severely stressed hypothetical scenarios.  This may allow 

firms to more accurately predict their required capital ratios, reducing capital planning 

255 See I. Goldstein & Y. Leitner, “Stress test disclosure: theory, practice, and new perspectives,” HANDBOOK OF 
FINANCIAL STRESS TESTING 208-223 (2022); B. Hirtle, “Structural and Cyclical Macroprudential Objectives in 
Supervisory Stress Testing,” Remarks at “The Effects of Post-Crisis Banking Reforms” conference (Jun. 22, 2018).

uncertainty257 and possibly increasing firms’ willingness to lend.258  Reduced capital requirement 

uncertainty could help firms better plan their future business decisions.  

d. 

Better informed investors and improved market discipline  

Research suggests that investors use stress test results to assess firms’ resilience.  Indeed, 

disclosures of results from the stress test tend to affect firms’ stock prices and CDS spreads.259  

Through such financial market signals, investors may help discipline firms’ risk taking.260  This 

“market discipline” may constrain risk taking and incentivize firms to strengthen capital 

positions.261  The comprehensive disclosure of the supervisory stress testing models may allow 

investors to make better informed decisions, potentially improving the effectiveness of market 

discipline.

Costs 

a. 

Reduced dynamism  

As discussed above, models are necessarily a simplified version of reality.  As 

forecasting methodologies evolve or conditions in the economy and the financial system change, 

the existing models may no longer adequately capture risks.  For this reason, an effective stress 

test must be able to adapt.  Under this proposal, material changes to the stress testing models 

would be published for comment, and the Board would be required to respond to such comment, 

before implementing the material model changes in the supervisory stress test.  This process 

would increase the resources needed to develop, propose, and implement material model 

changes, particularly to the extent that any changes are complex, present many alternatives, or 

affect firms’ ability to distribute capital.  As a result, the use of new models or model changes 

that explore risks that are less established may pose a high resource burden under the proposed 

enhanced disclosure regime, potentially limiting the supervisory stress test to simpler, less 

controversial, and more familiar approaches.262  Tests of new risk dimensions or emerging 

threats may take significantly more time to implement.  With less dynamism, the supervisory 

stress test may fail to capture new risks and could produce an increasingly stale view of how 

firms would be likely to perform under stressed conditions.263  In addition, as described in 

Section VI.A of this Supplementary Information, this proposal would change the jump-off date 

262 See M. Flannery, Transparency and model evolution in stress testing, SSRN Working Paper (2019), 
http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3431679.  Even the current approach to stress testing may not allow for the optimal 
level of dynamism or macroprudential considerations.  See D. Tarullo, Reconsidering the regulatory uses of stress 
testing, Hutchins Center Working Paper 92 (2024), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-
content/uploads/2024/05/WP92_Tarullo-stress-testing.pdf; W. Bassett & D. Rappoport, “Enhancing stress tests by 
adding macroprudential elements,” in HANDBOOK OF FINANCIAL STRESS TESTING 455–83 (2022). 

263 For an example of the reduced utility of a stale stress model, see W. Frame et al., The failure of supervisory stress 
testing: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and OFHEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper 15-4 (2015),

of the supervisory and company-run stress tests from December 31 to September 30, to allow the 

Board to publish the annually disclosed stress test information for comment after the jump-off 

date of the stress test and to prevent firms from adjusting their exposures based on the published 

information.  As a result, the tested balance sheets would be older by one quarter, which would 

add additional staleness to the stress test and stress test results, because firm balance sheets as 

well as economic conditions could change substantially within a quarter. 

b. 

Reduced risk sensitivity and overreliance on a single model framework 

Supervisory stress testing results are important inputs to the capital requirements 

associated with firms’ banking activities.  With comprehensive model disclosure likely reducing 

the uncertainty of supervisory stress test results, firms’ estimates of future regulatory capital 

requirements could rely more on the Board’s stress test models and less on their own internal 

stress testing models or internal risk management tools, both of which may be less useful than 

before for managing regulatory capital.264  To the extent that firms’ own internal stress testing 

models or risk management tools provide additional information about risk, the expected capital 

requirements could become less risk-sensitive as a result and it may reduce firms’ incentives to 

independently measure and manage their vulnerabilities. 

Disclosure could also enable firms to more easily optimize their exposures to minimize 

capital requirements in the supervisory stress test, which could allow vulnerabilities to build up 

where risks are not well or fully accounted for by standardized supervisory models.

Page 230 of 294 

 
 
Reliance on the supervisory stress testing models could extend further if disclosure 

results in firms increasing the similarity of their own stress models to the stress test models.265  

Increased reliance of all stress tested firms on a single model, known as “model monoculture,” or 

delaying material model changes while risks build up in areas that are treated benignly in the 

stress test would pose risks, as firms may face a greater incentive to shift business activities 

towards these areas to reduce their capital requirements.266  The resulting convergence of risk 

taking could increase the vulnerability of the banking system, particularly to those risks that are 

under-reflected by the supervisory stress testing models.267   

Conclusion 

As discussed in the introduction to Section X.D of this Supplementary Information, the 

Board’s supervisory stress test has historically operated with partial disclosure regarding the 

stress test models used.  The comprehensive model documentation published in connection with 

this proposal, as well as the proposed enhanced disclosure process, provides several benefits that 

outweigh the costs of the proposal.  

265 Of course, as noted above, there is benefit to these changes to the extent that they are adopted to improve the 
ability of firms’ models to capture risk. 

266 Relatedly, banks may have a stronger incentive to temporarily curtail those risk exposures treated adversely by 
the stress testing models, i.e., to “window dress.”  See P. Alexander, “How banks game stress tests: the ‘shocking’ 
truth,” Risk.net (Sep. 30, 2019), https://www.risk.net/regulation/6989811/how-banks-game-stress-tests-the-

XI.  Administrative Law Matters 

A.  Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis 

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 

U.S.C. 3501–3521), the Board may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to 

respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management 

and Budget (OMB) control number.  The Board reviewed the information collections related to 

the proposed rule under the authority delegated to the Board by OMB. 

The proposed rule would not create any information collections subject to the PRA; 

however, the Board is proposing to revise the FR Y-14A/Q/M to reduce regulatory reporting 

burden by retiring items and removing supporting documentation requirements that are no longer 

needed to conduct the supervisory stress test.  Additionally, the Board is proposing to collect 

additional information to support the proposed supervisory stress test models.  

The Board invites public comment on the following information collection: 

(a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the 

Board’s functions, including whether the information has practical utility; 

Page 232 of 294 

 
(b) The accuracy of the Board’s estimate of the burden of the proposed information 

collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; 

(c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; 

(d) Ways to minimize the burden of the information collection on respondents, including 

through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 

technology; and 

(e) Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of 

services to provide information. 

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority to Extend for Three Years, With Revision, the 

Following Information Collection 

Collection title: Capital Assessments and Stress Testing Reports.  

Collection identifier: FR Y-14A/Q/M.  

OMB control number: 7100-0341.  

General description of collection: This family of information collections is composed of 

the following three reports:  

•  The annual FR Y-14A collects quantitative projections of balance sheet, income, losses, 

and capital across a range of macroeconomic scenarios and qualitative information on 

methodologies used to develop internal projections of capital across scenarios.268  

•  The quarterly FR Y-14Q collects granular data on various asset classes, including loans, 

securities, trading assets, and pre-provision net revenue for the reporting period. 

268 In certain circumstances, a firm may be required to re-submit its capital plan.  See 12 CFR 225.8(e)(4); 12 CFR 
238.170(e)(4).  Firms that must re-submit their capital plan generally also must provide a revised FR Y-14A in 
connection with their resubmission. 

Page 233 of 294 

 
 
•  The monthly FR Y-14M is comprised of three retail portfolio- and loan-level schedules, 

and one detailed address-matching schedule to supplement two of the portfolio- and loan-

level schedules. 

The data collected through the FR Y-14A/Q/M provide the Board with the information 

needed to help ensure that large firms have strong, firm-wide risk measurement and management 

processes supporting their internal assessments of capital adequacy and that their capital 

resources are sufficient, given their business focus, activities, and resulting risk exposures.  The 

data within the reports are used in connection with setting firms’ stress capital buffer 

requirements.  The data are also used to support other Board supervisory efforts aimed at 

enhancing the continued viability of large firms, including continuous monitoring of firms’ 

planning and management of liquidity and funding resources, as well as regular assessments of 

credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, and associated risk management practices.  

Information gathered in this collection is also used in the supervision and regulation of 

respondent financial institutions.  Respondent firms are currently required to complete and 

submit up to 17 filings each year: one annual FR Y-14A filing, four quarterly FR Y-14Q filings, 

and 12 monthly FR Y-14M filings.269  Compliance with the information collection is mandatory.  

Current Actions: The proposal would modify the FR Y-14A/Q/M to remove supporting 

documentation requirements, schedules, and data items that are no longer needed to conduct the 

supervisory stress test.  The proposal would also make other revisions necessary to facilitate the 

stress test modeling decisions.  All proposed revisions would be effective for the September 30, 

2026, report date.  

269 Holding companies that do not meet the materiality thresholds described in the instructions for the FR Y-14M are 
not required to file that report.  This results in some holding companies submitting fewer than 17 filings each year.

Supporting Documentation 

a. 

FR Y-14A 

The FR Y-14A collects detailed data on firms’ quantitative projections of assets, 

liabilities, income, losses, and capital across a range of macroeconomic scenarios.  Firms are also 

required to provide qualitative information on the methodologies used to develop their 

projections and any other analysis that supports or contributes to these projections.  This 

qualitative supporting documentation helps supervisors assess the accuracy and 

comprehensiveness of the projections included in firms’ FR Y-14A submissions.  This 

information was previously critical to assess the data systems and modeling methodologies that 

firms used to report the FR Y-14A.  However, as these systems and frameworks have matured, 

much of the supporting documentation has become outdated or is not needed by supervisors to 

make such assessments.  To ensure that the FR Y-14A requirements do not capture information 

that is no longer needed and to reduce reporting burden, the Board is proposing to remove 

Appendix A “Supporting Documentation” from the FR Y-14A.  However, supervisors may 

request similar information to what is currently required from Appendix A from firms through 

supervisory channels, as deemed appropriate and on a targeted basis, in support of the annual 

capital plan review.  Firms would only be expected to provide information that supervisors 

request each cycle.  The proposed removal of the FR Y-14A supporting documentation reporting 

requirement would not impact any other capital planning expectations.  

b. 

FR Y-14Q 

FR Y-14Q, Schedule L (Counterparty) collects data on firms’ counterparty credit risk, 

including derivative and securities financing transaction exposures.  Applicable firms are 

required to report two versions of Schedule L: an “unstressed” version under the actual economic 

Page 235 of 294 

 
conditions on the reported date, and a “stressed” version under the hypothetical stress scenarios 

used in the supervisory and company-run stress tests.  To support firms’ estimates of credit 

valuation adjustment and counterparty losses under the stress scenarios, the FR Y-14Q requires 

that firms provide detailed descriptions of the methodologies used to generate values for the 

“stressed” version.  As for the FR Y-14A, this information was previously important in 

understanding firms’ counterparty submissions but is no longer required for supervisors to assess 

Schedule L data.  However, the Board has identified supporting information that is relevant to 

understanding a firm’s estimated credit valuation adjustment and largest counterparty default 

losses.  Therefore, to streamline Schedule L and reduce reporting burden, the Board is proposing 

replacing the existing Schedule L supporting documentation with this more limited set of 

questions.  These questions would concern excluded counterparties, estimation assumptions, 

drivers of changes in credit valuation adjustment, and other related topics.  

Similarly, qualitative information is needed to assess firms’ trading mark-to-market 

projections under the global market shock.  As a firm’s projections are directly connected to the 

exposures reported on FR Y-14Q, Schedule F (Trading), the Board is proposing to introduce 

supporting documentation for Schedule F that includes five questions related to a firm’s trading 

projections and Schedule F submissions.  Together with the Schedule L supporting 

documentation, this would ensure that supervisors have the necessary information to assess a 

firm’s projections under the global market shock.   

Home Equity Data Collection 

FR Y-14M, Schedule B.1 (Home Equity Loan-Level Table) collects loan-level data on 

firms’ HELOCs.  These data are used in support of stress test modeling and monitoring of firms’ 

home equity portfolios.  The Board has identified several items on Schedule B.1 that are not 

Page 236 of 294 

 
needed to assess a home equity loan or HELOC’s risk characteristics or are captured elsewhere 

on Schedule B.1.  Therefore, to maintain appropriate risk coverage and reduce reporting burden, 

the Board is proposing to retire the following fields from Schedule B.1.

Collection of Mailing Address Information 

Page 237 of 294 

 
FR Y-14M, Schedule C (Address Matching) collects address information on each loan 

reported on FR Y-14M, Schedule A (First Lien) or Schedule B (Home Equity).  This collection 

includes both property and mailing address data used in support of the supervisory stress test 

models.  However, the Board has determined that the mailing address items are no longer needed 

for stress testing or supervisory purposes.  Therefore, the Board is proposing to remove item 6 

(Mailing Stress Address), item 7 (Mailing City), item 8 (Mailing State), and item 9 (Mailing Zip 

Code) from Schedule C. 

Unpaid Principal Balance 

FR Y-14M, Schedule B.1 item 95 (Unpaid Principal Balance (Net)) collects information 

on the current net unpaid principal balance of a home equity line of credit.  The instructions 

provide a definition for calculating net unpaid principal balance and note that this value should 

equal the book value on regulatory filings.  However, reporting of unpaid principal balance can 

vary across regulatory reporting, including by considering loan premiums, which item 95 does 

not include.  To address this inconsistency, the Board is proposing to remove this language from 

the instructions for item 95.  

Private Equity 

Beginning with the 2025 supervisory stress test, the Board calculated losses on private 

equity exposures under the macroeconomic scenario over a nine-quarter projection horizon as 

opposed to under the GMS, which would have considered the impact only in the first quarter of 

the projection horizon.  As described in the Board’s 2025 Supervisory Stress Test Methodology 

disclosure,270 the new treatment better aligns with the characteristics of private equity exposures, 

270 See Board, 2025 Stress Test Scenarios (Feb. 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-
stress-test-scenarios-20250205.pdf. 

Page 238 of 294 

 
 
which are principally long-term investments that are managed as banking book positions.  To 

better capture private equity data in a manner that aligns with this new treatment, the Board is 

proposing several revisions to FR Y-14Q, Schedule F (Trading). 

First, the Board is proposing to move the fourth quarter as-of date for reported private 

equity exposures to December 31 of a given year, as opposed to the as-of date of the GMS.  

Schedule F is reported on a quarterly basis.  However, to gather data necessary to subject firms 

to the GMS, firms are required to report Schedule F as of the GMS as-of date and not as of 

December 31 for the fourth quarter submission.  Therefore, the Board is proposing to require 

private equity exposures to be reported as of December 31, as private equity exposures are no 

longer stressed under the GMS. 

Second, the Board is proposing to revise Schedule F such that private equity carry values 

are reported net of embedded goodwill or investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial 

institutions that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.  The Board’s capital rule 

provides that certain amounts of goodwill and investments in the capital of unconsolidated 

financial institutions be deducted from CET1 capital,271 and the carry value of private equity 

exposures reported on Schedule F can be affected by these deducted amounts.   

Firms subject to Category I through III standards are required to report these deduction 

items on FR Y-14A, Schedule A.1.d (Capital).  To ensure that deductions are not double-counted 

when calculating trading and counterparty losses, firms may report an adjusted starting value for 

these items to reflect the impact of the global market shock.  However, as currently reported, a 

portion of these amounts may be attributable to private equity.  Therefore, the Board is proposing 

revising Schedule F to require firms to exclude the amounts attributable to private equity from 

271 See 12 CFR 217.22. 

Page 239 of 294 

 
 
the carry value.  This revision would ensure that losses are not assigned to balances that have 

been deducted from capital when calculating private equity losses. 

Third, the Board is proposing to require hedges on private equity exposures to be 

separately reported on Schedule F.  Hedges on private equity exposures are currently reported on 

Schedule F but are not segmented from other hedges on trading exposures.  Given that private 

equity exposures are no longer stressed as part of the GMS, the Board is proposing to require 

hedges on private equity exposures to be reported separately so that they can be considered as 

part of the macroeconomic scenario. 

Lastly, the Board is proposing to implement a new materiality threshold for the reporting 

of Schedule F.24 (Private Equity).  Currently, Schedule F.24 is reported only by firms subject to 

Category I through III standards with substantial trading operations, which is defined as having, 

on average for four quarters, aggregate trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more, or 

aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10 percent or more of total consolidated assets.  

However, private equity exposures are primarily banking book positions for which the FR Y-14 

uses a separate reporting threshold.  For firms subject to Category IV standards, material 

portfolios for banking book positions are defined as those with asset balances greater than $5 

billion or with asset balances greater than ten percent of tier 1 capital on average for the four 

quarters preceding the reporting period.  For firms subject to Category I through III standards, 

material portfolios for banking book positions are defined as those with asset balances greater 

than $5 billion or asset balances greater than five percent of tier 1 capital on average for the four 

quarters preceding the reporting period.   

To align the materiality threshold for private equity with other banking book schedules, 

the Board is proposing to revise the FR Y-14Q instructions to apply the materiality threshold to 

Page 240 of 294 

 
Schedule F.24 that is currently applied to the banking book schedules.  Additionally, since a firm 

subject to Category IV standards could have its private equity losses contribute to its supervisory 

stress test results, the Board also proposes to require a firm subject to Category IV standards to 

submit Schedule F.24 if it meets the proposed materiality threshold.  Similarly, consistent with 

reporting expectations for other banking book positions, the Board is proposing to update FR Y-

14Q, Schedule K (Supplemental) such that firms report the carrying value of funded and 

unfunded private equity exposures that do not meet the materiality threshold for Schedule F.24 

reporting.  These revisions would ensure consistent reporting and treatment of private equity in 

the supervisory stress test.  

Additionally, the Board is proposing a revision to FR Y-14A, Schedule A.4 (Trading) 

which captures trading profit and loss projections under the global market shock.  As private 

equity shocks are no longer included in the global market shock, items related to private equity 

are no longer needed to capture trading profit and loss projections.  Therefore, the Board is 

proposing to remove item 15 (“Private Equity”), item 15A (“Private Equity: Funded”), item 15B 

(“Private Equity: Unfunded”), item 15C (“Private Equity: Other”) from Schedule A.4.  

Other Hedges 

Currently, the FR Y-14Q captures certain types of hedges, including hedges on accrual 

loans and loans held under the fair value option and certain designated accounting hedges on 

securities, but is not comprehensive, which limits the ability of the supervisory stress test to 

account for these positions.  For example, FR Y-14Q, Schedule B (Securities) does not provide 

sufficient information to independently revalue the hedging instrument.  Additionally, interest 

rate risk hedges that are used to mitigate risk on instruments other than securities from changes 

in interest rates are not captured by the FR Y-14Q.  Schedule B was designed to capture basic 

Page 241 of 294 

 
information on traditional hedges on securities and does not consistently and comprehensively 

capture portfolio layer method or interest rate risk hedges for valuation purposes.   

Separately, fair value option hedges are positions that are used to hedge loan assets that 

are held-for-sale or held under fair value option accounting, and do not meet the definition of 

trading assets or liabilities.  This includes synthetic securitizations, a form of loss mitigation in 

which a firm partially transfers credit risk on specific portfolios to outside investors through 

credit derivatives or guarantees.  Fair value option hedges are currently reported as a separate 

instance of Schedule F.  However, Schedule F is subject to a materiality threshold, so fair value 

option hedges are not reported comprehensively by all relevant firms on the FR Y-14Q.   

To improve the risk capture of the supervisory stress test by incorporating the effects of 

additional hedges, the Board is proposing to revise FR Y-14Q, Schedule B.2 (Investment 

Securities with Designated Accounting Hedges) to capture all qualified accounting hedges, 

including portfolio layer method and all designated accounting hedges.  Additionally, the Board 

is proposing to implement FR Y-14Q, Schedule B.3 to more comprehensively map hedging 

relationships.  Similarly, the Board is proposing to revise Schedule F to capture data on hedges 

from any firms with reportable hedges.  

Question 53: Would the new fields proposed in FR Y-14Q, Schedule B.2 or B.3 prove 

burdensome to report for firms? 

Question 54: Do the new fields proposed in  FR Y-14Q, Schedule B.2 provide sufficient 

information to independently model the value of the hedging instrument? 

Question 55: Should changes be made to the fields or definitions proposed in FR Y-14Q, 

Schedule B.2 to better account for more esoteric derivatives such as swaptions, cap, or 

floors? 

Page 242 of 294 

 
Exchange Traded Funds 

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds comprised of exposures to multiple 

underlying assets, such as commodities, equities, or currencies.  Currently, Schedule F instructs 

firms to decompose certain ETF exposures based on the fund’s underlying assets.  However, the 

instructions also provide that all other ETFs should be reported in the equity worksheets.  This 

ambiguity may lead to classifying non-equity ETFs in the equity worksheets.   

All ETFs should be reported based on the underlying asset holdings and associated risk 

factors.  For example, ETFs for which rates or credit exposures are the underlying holdings 

should be reported on the corresponding worksheet.  To provide clarity and ensure consistent 

reporting, the Board is proposing to clarify the Schedule F instructions such that all ETFs are 

reported in the worksheet that corresponds to the underlying asset class and risk exposures.  

Credit Card Revenue and Loss Share Agreements 

Revenue and loss sharing agreements (RLSAs) are partnership agreements firms have 

with private entities to share a portion of profits, revenues, and/or losses generated by a specified 

asset.  As discussed in the Credit Cards Model description, the Board accounts for private 

RLSAs when projecting credit card losses in the supervisory stress test.  Currently, the Board’s 

adjustment accounts for a specific case where a firm accounts for loss sharing payments by 

reducing provisions.  However, as agreement terms and reporting practices vary, the current 

adjustment may not fully or consistently address differential RLSA treatment across firms.  

Therefore, the Board is considering additional enhancements to the current RLSA adjustment to 

more comprehensively capture RLSAs in the supervisory stress test.  Specifically, the Board is 

considering one modeling approach that would account for RLSAs at the portfolio level and a 

second that would account for RLSAs at the agreement level.  To facilitate the portfolio level 

Page 243 of 294 

 
enhancement, the Board is proposing to collect portfolio level details on FR Y-14M, Schedule D 

(Credit Card) of individual revenue components (e.g., interest income, interest expense, 

noninterest income, and noninterest expense), charge-offs and recoveries, and provision build.  

Additionally, the amount of each that is subject to partner sharing agreements and where the 

partner shares portions of each are reported on the FR Y-9C, as well as the shared amounts of net 

profit, net revenue, and net charge offs.  To facilitate the agreement level enhancement, the 

Board is proposing to collect the same information at the agreement level, as well as effective 

share rates and contractual share rates of the individual revenue, loss, and provision 

components.  For both approaches, the Board is proposing to expand Schedule D.1, item 70 

(“Loss Sharing”) to collect information on the type of RLSA.  If either the portfolio level or 

agreement level enhancement is adopted, the Board would only adopt the corresponding FR Y-

14 revisions.  If the Board does not adopt either enhancement to the RLSA adjustment, then 

neither set of revisions would be implemented.  If either RLSA modeling enhancement is 

adopted, the corresponding FR Y-14 revision would represent an increase in estimated FR Y-14 

burden hours of approximately 2,500 hours if adopted.  

Stress Test Date Changes 

a. 

FR Y-14A Jump-off Date 

The FR Y-14A collects data on firms’ projections of balance sheet asset and liabilities, 

income, losses, and capital across a range of hypothetical scenarios.  These projections span a 

nine-quarter horizon beginning with the first quarter of the year in which the report is filed. This 

means that the jump-off date for the FR Y-14A is December 31 of the previous year, consistent 

with the supervisory stress test.  However, as discussed in Section VI.A of this Supplementary 

Page 244 of 294 

 
Information, the Board is proposing to shift the jump-off date of the stress test to September 30 

so that the scenarios are released for comment after the finalization of firms’ balance sheets. 

Consistent with this proposed jump-off date change, the Board is proposing to modify the 

FR Y-14A to use a September 30 jump-off date.  These revisions would include updating the 

instructions to note that the projection horizon begins in the fourth quarter of the year preceding 

the reporting year, and noting that firms should report actual capital actions in the first and 

second quarters of the projection horizon, as they occur before the due date.  The FR Y-14A and 

capital plans would still be due April 5.   

b. 

Global Market Shock as-of Date Submissions 

As discussed in Section VI.B of this Supplementary Information, the Board is proposing 

to expand the as-of date range for the global market shock to be between October 1 of two years 

prior to a given stress test cycle to October 1 of the year prior to a given stress test cycle.  To 

facilitate this proposed change, the Board is proposing several changes to the FR Y-14A and FR 

Y-14Q.  

On the FR Y-14A, the Board is proposing to update Schedule A.4 (Trading) and 

Schedule A.5 (Counterparty) such that the as-of date for these schedules may fall between 

October 1 of two years prior to a given stress test cycle to October 1 of the year prior to a given 

stress test cycle.  These schedules would still be due on April 5 of the following year.  

Currently, the fourth quarter submissions of FR Y-14Q, Schedule F (Trading) and 

Schedule L (Counterparty) are submitted as of the global market shock as-of date instead of 

quarter end.  However, under the proposal, the as-of date for the global market shock could fall 

in a quarter other than the fourth quarter.  Therefore, Board is proposing to modify the 

submission cadence for Schedule F (Trading) and Schedule L (Counterparty) such that, for 

Page 245 of 294 

 
whichever quarter contains the global market shock as-of date, Schedule F and Schedule L 

would be submitted as of that date, as opposed to quarter end.  Submissions for all other quarters 

would be submitted as-of quarter end.   

Question 56: What, if any, other FR Y-14 revisions are needed to facilitate the proposed 

changes to the stress test jump-off date and global market shock as-of date? 

Frequency: Annually, quarterly, and monthly.  

Respondents: Holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, 

as based on (1) the average of the firm’s total consolidated assets in the four most recent quarters 

as reported quarterly on the firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies 

(FR Y-9C; OMB No. 7100-0128) or (2) the average of the firm’s total consolidated assets in the 

most recent consecutive quarters as reported quarterly on the firm’s FR Y-9Cs, if the firm has 

not filed an FR Y-9C for each of the most recent four quarters.  

Total estimated number of respondents: 35.  

Estimated change in burden: 

•  FR Y-14A: -4,235 hours 
•  FR Y-14Q: -700 hours 
•  FR Y-14M: +792 hours 
•  Total estimated change in burden: −4,143.  

Total estimated annual burden hours: 757,696. 

B.  Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 

The Board is providing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with respect to this 

proposed rule.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)272 requires an agency to consider whether 

the rules it proposes will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 

272 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. 

Page 246 of 294 

 
 
 
 
entities.273  In connection with a proposed rule, the RFA requires an agency to prepare and invite 

public comment on an initial regulatory flexibility analysis describing the impact of the rule on 

small entities, unless the agency certifies that the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a 

significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  An initial regulatory 

flexibility analysis must contain (1) a description of the reasons why action by the agency is 

being considered; (2) a succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed 

rule; (3) a description of, and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to 

which the proposed rule will apply; (4) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, 

and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of 

small entities that will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary 

for preparation of the report or record; (5) an identification, to the extent practicable, of all 

relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, overlap with, or conflict with the proposed rule; and 

(6) a description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated 

objectives of applicable statutes and minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed 

rule on small entities.  

The Board has considered the potential impact of the proposed rule on small entities in 

accordance with the RFA.  Based on its analysis and for the reasons stated below, the Board 

believes that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 

number of small entities.  Nevertheless, the Board is publishing and inviting comment on this 

273  Under regulations issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), a small entity includes a depository 
institution, bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company with total assets of $850 million or less.  
13 CFR 121.201.  Consistent with the SBA’s General Principles of Affiliation, the Board includes the assets of all 
domestic and foreign affiliates toward the applicable size threshold when determining whether to classify a 
particular entity as a small entity.  13 CFR 121.103.  As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 2,364 
small bank holding companies, approximately 85 small savings and loan holding companies, and approximately 451 
small state member banks. 

Page 247 of 294 

 
 
initial regulatory flexibility analysis.  In connection with this proposal, the Board also proposes 

to make changes to the Board’s reporting forms. 

As discussed in detail above, under the proposal, the Board is inviting public comment on 

the models used to conduct the Board’s supervisory stress test, changes to those models to be 

implemented in the 2026 stress test, and proposed changes to enhance the transparency and 

public accountability of the Board’s stress testing framework.  The proposal would amend the 

Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing, including to implement 

guides for additional scenario variables, and the Stress Testing Policy Statement.  The proposal 

would also codify an enhanced disclosure process under which the Board would annually publish 

comprehensive documentation on the stress test models, invite public comment on any material 

changes that the Board seeks to make to those models, and annually publish the stress test 

scenarios for comment.  Lastly, the proposal would make changes to the FR Y-14A/Q/M to 

remove items that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test and to collect 

additional data to support the stress test models and improve risk capture.  

As discussed above, several statutory authorities, including the International Lending 

Supervision Act of 1983,274 section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act,275 the International 

Banking Act,276 section 10(g) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act,277 and section 165 of the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)278 (as amended by 

section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act279), 

274 See 12 U.S.C. 3902(1); 3907(a); 3909(a). 

275 12 U.S.C. 1844(b). 

276 See 12 U.S.C. 3106. 

277 See 12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1). 

278 Dodd-Frank Act, supra note 2. 

279 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, supra note 3. 

Page 248 of 294 

 
 
provide authority for the Board’s stress testing and stress capital buffer framework, including this 

proposed rule. 

The International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 provides the Board with broad 

discretionary authority to set minimum capital levels for state member banks and affiliates of 

insured depository institutions, including holding companies, supervised by the Board.280  Under 

section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Board may issue such regulations and orders 

relating to capital requirements of bank holding companies as may be necessary for the Board to 

carry out the purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act.281  Foreign banking organizations 

with a U.S. subsidiary bank, branch, or agency are made subject by the International Banking 

Act to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act in the same manner as bank holding 

companies;282 therefore, the Board is also authorized under section 5(b) of the Bank Holding 

Company Act to impose these requirements on those foreign banking organizations.   

Similarly, with regard to savings and loan holding companies, section 10(g) of the Home 

Owners’ Loan Act authorizes the Board to issue such regulations and orders relating to capital 

requirements as the Board deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of the 

Home Owners’ Loan Act.283  Moreover, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by 

section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, requires 

the Board to establish risk-based capital requirements for large bank holding companies and 

nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board.284  Additionally, section 165(i)(1) of the 

280 See 12 U.S.C. 3902(1); 3907(a); 3909(a). 

281 12 U.S.C. 1844(b). 

282 See 12 U.S.C. 3106. 

283 See 12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1). 

284 See 12 U.S.C. 5365(b)(1)(A)(i). 

Page 249 of 294 

 
 
Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and 

Consumer Protection Act, requires the Board to conduct an annual supervisory stress test of 

these large firms.285 

The proposed rule would apply to bank holding companies, U.S. intermediate holding 

companies of foreign banking organizations, and savings and loan holding companies, each with 

at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets, as well as state member banks with more than 

$250 billion in total consolidated assets, certain nonbank financial companies supervised by the 

Board, and any other bank holding company or covered savings and loan holding company 

domiciled in the United States that is made subject to the capital plan rule by order of the 

Board.286  The proposed rule would not apply to any small entities.  Further, although the Board 

does not project there to be a direct impact to reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance 

requirements as a result of the proposed rule, the Board also is proposing to revise the FR Y-

14A/Q/M (Capital Assessments and Stress Testing) reports to remove items that are no longer 

needed to conduct the supervisory stress test and to collect data that would improve the 

calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement.  These reports are submitted by firms subject 

to the Board’s capital plan rule requirements; thus, the changes would not impact small entities.  

In addition, the Board is aware of no other Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with 

the proposed changes to the capital and stress testing rules.  Accordingly, the Board believes that 

the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 

banking organizations supervised by the Board and, therefore, believes that there are no 

285 See 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1). 

286  There currently are no entities with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets subject to the capital plan 
rule or to the stress test rules. 

Page 250 of 294 

 
 
significant alternatives to the proposed rule that would reduce the economic impact on small 

banking organizations supervised by the Board. 

The Board welcomes comment on all aspects of its analysis.  

C.  Plain Language 

 Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub.  L.  No.  106-102, 113 Stat. 1338, 

1471, 12 U.S.C. 4809) requires the federal banking agencies to use plain language in all 

proposed and final rules published after January 1, 2000.  The Board has sought to present the 

notice of proposed rulemaking in a simple and straightforward manner and invites comment on 

the use of plain language.  For example: 

• 

Is the material organized to suit your needs?  If not, how could the Board present the 

proposed rule more clearly? 

•  Are the requirements in the proposed rule clearly stated?  If not, how could the proposed 

rule be more clearly stated? 

•  Does the proposal contain technical language or jargon that is not clear?  If so, which 

language requires clarification? 

•  Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing) 

make the proposed rule easier to understand?  If so, what changes would achieve that? 

• 

Is this section format adequate?  If not, which of the sections should be changed and 

how? 

•  What other changes can the Board incorporate to make the proposed rule easier to 

understand? 

D.  Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023 

The Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023 (12 U.S.C. 553(b)(4)) 

requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking include the Internet address of a summary of not 

Page 251 of 294 

 
more than 100 words in length of the proposed rule, in plain language, that shall be posted on the 

Internet website under section 206(d) of the E-Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 note).

impact on the post-stress CET1 regulatory capital ratio of any covered company, or on the 

average post-stress CET1 capital ratios of all covered companies required to participate in the 

upcoming stress test cycle, including covered companies under 12 CFR part 252, subpart E, 

based on the prior year’s severely adverse scenario and prior year’s input data, equal to (i) a 

Page 256 of 294 

 
  
change of 20 basis points or more in the projected CET1 ratio of any such covered company; or 

(ii) a change of 10 basis points or more in the average of the absolute change to the values of the 

projected CET1 ratios of such covered companies. 

Model change means the introduction of a new model or a conceptual change to an existing 
model.  

Models means the analytical techniques that the Board determines are appropriate for use in the 
supervisory stress test.

Appendix A to Part 252—Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress 

Testing  

18. Appendix A to part 252 is revised to read as follows: 

1.  Background  

(a)  The Board has imposed stress testing requirements through its regulations (stress test 

rules) implementing section 165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act), section 10(g) of the Home 
Owners’ Loan Act, and section 401(e) of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, 
and Consumer Protection Act, and through its capital plan rule (12 CFR 225.8).  Under 
the stress test rules, the Board conducts a supervisory stress test of each bank holding 
company with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, intermediate holding 
company of a foreign banking organization with total consolidated assets of $100 
billion or more, and nonbank financial company that the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council has designated for supervision by the Board (together, covered companies).287  
In addition, under the stress test rules, certain firms are also subject to company-run 
stress test requirements.288 The Board will provide two different sets of conditions 

287 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1); 12 CFR part 252, subpart E. 

288 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2); 12 CFR part 252, subparts B and F. 

Page 268 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
(each set, a scenario), including baseline and severely adverse scenario for both 
supervisory and company-run stress tests (macroeconomic scenarios).289 

(b) The stress test rules provide that the Board will notify covered companies by no later 
than February 15 of each year of the scenarios it will use to conduct its supervisory 
stress tests and provide, also by no later than February 15, covered companies and 
other financial companies subject to the final rules the set of scenarios they must use to 
conduct their company-run stress tests. Under the stress test rules, the Board may 
require certain companies to use additional components in the severely adverse 
scenario or additional scenarios. For example, the Board expects to require large 
banking organizations with significant trading activities to include a trading and 
counterparty component (market shock, described in the following sections) in their 
severely adverse scenario.  The Board will provide any additional components or 
scenarios by no later than March 1 of each year.290  The Board expects that the 
scenarios it will require the companies to use will be the same as those the Board will 
use to conduct its supervisory stress tests (together, stress test scenarios). 

(c)  In addition, § 225.8 of the Board’s Regulation Y (capital plan rule) requires covered 

companies to submit annual capital plans, including stress test results, to the Board in 
order to allow the Board to assess whether they have robust, forward-looking capital 
planning processes and have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times 
of economic and financial stress.291  

(d) Stress tests required under the stress test rules and under the capital plan rule require 
the Board and financial companies to calculate pro-forma capital levels—rather than 
“current” or actual levels—over a specified planning horizon under baseline and 
stressful scenarios. This approach integrates key lessons of the 2007-2009 financial 
crisis and subsequent stress events into the Board’s supervisory framework. During the 
financial crisis, investor and counterparty confidence in the capitalization of financial 
companies eroded rapidly in the face of changes in the current and expected economic 
and financial conditions, and this loss in market confidence imperiled companies’ 
ability to access funding, continue operations, serve as a credit intermediary, and meet 
obligations to creditors and counterparties. Importantly, such a loss in confidence 
occurred even when a financial institution’s capital ratios were in excess of regulatory 
minimums.  This is because the institution’s capital ratios were perceived as lagging 
indicators of its financial condition, particularly when conditions were changing. 

289 The stress test rules define scenarios as those sets of conditions that affect the United States economy or the 
financial condition of a company that the Board determines are appropriate for use in stress tests, including, but not 
limited to, baseline and severely adverse scenarios. The stress test rules define baseline scenario as a set of 
conditions that affect the United States economy or the financial condition of a company and that reflect the 
consensus views of the economic and financial outlook. The stress test rules define severely adverse scenario as a set 
of conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of a company and that overall are significantly 
more severe than those associated with the baseline scenario and may include trading or other additional 
components.

(e)  The stress tests required under the stress test rules and capital plan rule are a valuable 

supervisory tool that provide a forward-looking assessment of large financial 
companies’ capital adequacy under hypothetical economic and financial market 
conditions. Currently, these stress tests primarily focus on credit risk, operational risk, 
and market risk—that is, risk of mark-to-market losses associated with companies’ 
trading and counterparty positions—and not on other types of risk, such as liquidity 
risk. Pressures stemming from these sources are considered in separate supervisory 
exercises. No single supervisory tool, including the stress tests, can provide an 
assessment of a company’s ability to withstand every potential source of risk. 

(f)  Selecting appropriate scenarios is an especially significant consideration for stress 
tests required under the capital plan rule, which ties the review of a company’s 
performance under stress scenarios to its ability to make capital distributions. More 
severe scenarios, all other things being equal, generally translate into larger projected 
declines in banks’ capital. Thus, a company would need more capital today to meet its 
minimum capital requirements in more stressful scenarios and have the ability to 
continue making capital distributions, such as common dividend payments. This 
translation is far from mechanical, however; it will depend on factors that are specific 
to a given company, such as underwriting standards and the company’s business 
model, which would also greatly affect projected revenue, losses, and capital. 

2.   Overview and Scope 

(a)  This policy statement provides more detail on the characteristics of the stress test 

scenarios and explains the considerations and procedures that underlie the approach 
for formulating these scenarios. The considerations and procedures described in this 
policy statement apply to the Board’s stress testing framework, including to the stress 
tests required under 12 CFR part 252, subparts B, E, and F as well as the Board’s 
capital plan rule (12 CFR 225.8).292  

(b) Although the Board does not envision that the broad approach used to develop 

scenarios will change from year to year, the stress test scenarios will reflect changes in 
the outlook for economic and financial conditions and changes to specific risks or 
vulnerabilities that the Board, in consultation with the other federal banking agencies, 
determines should be considered in the annual stress tests. The stress test scenarios 
should not be regarded as forecasts; rather, they are hypothetical paths of economic 
variables that will be used to assess the strength and resilience of the companies’ 
capital in various economic and financial environments. 

(c)  The remainder of this policy statement is organized as follows. Section 3 provides a 
broad description of the baseline and severely adverse scenarios and describes the 
relationship between the macroeconomic scenario and the market shock component of 
the severely adverse scenario applicable to companies with significant trading activity.

This section also describes the types of variables that the Board expects to include in 
the macroeconomic scenarios and the market shock component. Section 4 describes 
the Board’s approach for developing the macroeconomic scenarios, and section 5 
describes the approach for the market shocks. Section 6 provides a timeline for the 
formulation and publication of the macroeconomic assumptions and market shocks. 

3.  Content of the Stress Test Scenarios 

(a)  The Board will publish two different scenarios, including baseline and severely 

adverse conditions, for use in stress tests required in the stress test rules.293 In general, 
the Board anticipates that it will not issue additional scenarios. Specific circumstances 
or vulnerabilities that in any given year the Board may determine require particular 
vigilance to help ensure the resilience of the banking sector may be captured in the 
severely adverse scenario, and are expected to be explained through the comment 
process in those stress test cycles.   

(b) While the Board generally expects to use the same scenarios for all companies subject 
to the final rule, it may require a subset of companies—depending on a company’s 
financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or activities, or 
risks to the U.S. economy—to include additional scenario components or additional 
scenarios that are designed to capture different effects of adverse events on revenue, 
losses, and capital. One example of such components is the market shock that applies 
only to companies with significant trading activity. Additional components or 
scenarios may also include other stress factors that may not necessarily be directly 
correlated to macroeconomic or financial assumptions but nevertheless can materially 
affect companies’ risks, such as the unexpected default of a major counterparty. 

(c)  Early in each stress testing cycle, the Board plans to publish the macroeconomic 
scenarios along with a brief narrative summary that provides a description of the 
economic situation underlying the scenario and explains how the scenarios have 
changed relative to the previous year. In addition, to assist companies in projecting the 
paths of additional variables in a manner consistent with the scenario, the narrative 
will provide descriptions of the general path of some additional variables. These 
descriptions will be general—that is, they will describe developments for broad classes 
of variables rather than for specific variables—and will specify the intensity and 
direction of variable changes but not numeric magnitudes. These descriptions should 
provide guidance that will be useful to companies in specifying the paths of the 
additional variables for their company-run stress tests. Note that in practice it will not 
be possible for the narrative to include descriptions of all the additional variables that 
companies may need for their company-run stress tests. In cases where scenarios are 
designed to reflect particular risks and vulnerabilities, the narrative will also explain 
the underlying motivation for these features of the scenario. The Board also plans to 
release a description of the market shock components.

3.1 Macroeconomic Scenarios 

(a)  The macroeconomic scenarios will consist of the future paths of a set of economic and 
financial variables.294 The economic and financial variables included in the scenarios 
will likely comprise those included in the “2014 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual 
Stress Tests Required under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Rules and the Capital 
Plan Rule” (2013 supervisory scenarios). The domestic U.S. variables provided for in 
the 2013 supervisory scenarios included: 

(1) Six measures of economic activity and prices: Real and nominal gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate of the civilian non-
institutional population aged 16 and over, real and nominal disposable personal 
income growth, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate; 

(2) Four measures of developments in equity and property markets: The Core 
Logic National House Price Index, the National Council for Real Estate 
Investment Fiduciaries Commercial Real Estate Price Index, the Dow Jones 
Total Stock Market Index, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market 
Volatility Index; and 

(3)  Six measures of interest rates: The rate on the 3-month Treasury bill, the yield 
on the 5-year Treasury bond, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, the yield 
on a 10-year BBB corporate security, the prime rate, and the interest rate 
associated with a conforming, conventional, fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. 

(b) The international variables provided for in the 2014 supervisory scenarios included, 

for the euro area, the United Kingdom, developing Asia, and Japan: 

(1) Percent change in real GDP; 

(2) Percent change in the CPI or local equivalent; and 

(3) The U.S./foreign currency exchange rate.295 

(c)  The economic variables included in the scenarios influence key items affecting 

financial companies’ net income, including pre-provision net revenue and credit losses 
on loans and securities. Moreover, these variables exhibit fairly typical trends in 
adverse economic climates that can have unfavorable implications for companies’ net 
income and, thus, capital positions. 

(d) The economic variables included in the scenario may change over time. For example, 
the Board may add variables to a scenario if the international footprint of companies 

294 The future path of a variable refers to its specification over a given time period.  For example, the path of 
unemployment can be described in percentage terms on a quarterly basis over the stress testing time horizon. 

295 The Board may increase the range of countries or regions included in future scenarios, as appropriate. 

Page 272 of 294 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that are subject to the stress testing rules changed notably over time such that the 
variables already included in the scenario no longer sufficiently capture the material 
risks of these companies. Alternatively, historical relationships between 
macroeconomic variables could change over time such that one variable (e.g., 
disposable personal income growth) that previously provided a good proxy for another 
(e.g., light vehicle sales) in modeling companies’ pre-provision net revenue or credit 
losses ceases to do so, resulting in the need to create a separate path, or alternative 
proxy, for the other variable. However, recognizing the amount of work required for 
companies to incorporate the scenario variables into their stress testing models, the 
Board expects to eliminate variables from the scenarios only in rare instances. 

(e)  The Board expects that the company may not use all of the variables provided in the 
scenario, if those variables are not appropriate to the company’s line of business, or 
may add additional variables, as appropriate. The Board expects the companies to 
ensure that the paths of such additional variables are consistent with the scenarios the 
Board provided. For example, the companies may use, as part of their internal stress 
test models, local-level variables, such as state-level unemployment rates or city-level 
house prices. While the Board does not plan to include local-level macro variables in 
the stress test scenarios it provides, it expects the companies to evaluate the paths of 
local-level macro variables as needed for their internal models, and ensure internal 
consistency between these variables and their aggregate, macro-economic 
counterparts. The Board will provide the macroeconomic scenario component of the 
stress test scenarios for a period that spans a minimum of 13 quarters. The scenario 
horizon reflects the supervisory stress test approach that the Board plans to use. Under 
the stress test rules, the Board will assess the effect of different scenarios on the 
consolidated capital of each company over a forward-looking planning horizon of at 
least nine quarters. 

3.2 Market Shock Component 

(a)  The market shock component of the severely adverse scenario will only apply to 

companies with significant trading activity and their subsidiaries.296 The component 
consists of large moves in market prices and rates that would be expected to generate 
losses. Market shocks differ from macroeconomic scenarios in several ways, both in 
their design and application. For instance, market shocks that might typically be 
observed over an extended period (e.g., 3 months) are assumed to affect the market 
value of the companies’ trading assets and liabilities immediately. In addition, under 
the stress test rules, the as-of date for market shocks will differ from the quarter-end, 
and the Board will provide the as-of date for market shocks no later than February 1 of 
each year. Finally, as described in section 4, the market shock includes a much larger 

296 Currently, companies with significant trading activity include any bank holding company or intermediate holding 
company that (1) has aggregate trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more, or aggregate trading assets and 
liabilities equal to 10 percent or more of total consolidated assets, and (2) is not a Category IV firm.  The Board may 
also subject a state member bank subsidiary of any such bank holding company to the market shock component.  
The set of companies subject to the market shock component could change over time as the size, scope, and 
complexity of financial company's trading activities evolve.   

Page 273 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
set of risk factors than the set of economic and financial variables included in 
macroeconomic scenarios. Broadly, these risk factors include shocks to financial 
market variables that affect asset prices, such as a credit spread or the yield on a bond, 
and, in some cases, the value of the position itself (e.g., the market value of securitized 
positions). 

(b) The Board envisions that the market shocks will include shocks to a broad range of 

risk factors that are similar in granularity to those risk factors that trading companies 
use internally to produce profit and loss estimates, under stressful market scenarios, 
for all asset classes that are considered trading assets, including public equities, credit, 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodities. Examples of risk factors 
include, but are not limited to: 

(1)  Public equity indices to which companies with significant trading activity 
may have exposure, along with term structures of implied volatilities; 
(2)  Cross-currency foreign exchange rates of selected currencies, along term 

structures of implied volatilities; 

(3)  Term structures of government rates (e.g., U.S. Treasuries), interbank rates 

(e.g., swap rates) and potentially other key rates (e.g., commercial paper) for 
developed markets and for developing and emerging market nations to 
which companies may have exposure; 

(4)  Term structures of implied volatilities that are key inputs to the pricing of 

interest rate derivatives; 

(5)  Term structures of futures prices for energy products including crude oil 

(differentiated by country of origin), natural gas, and power; 

(6)  Term structures of futures prices for metals and agricultural commodities; 

and 

(7)  Credit spreads or instrument prices for credit-sensitive product segments 
including: corporate bonds, credit default swaps, and collateralized debt 
obligations by risk; non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities and 
commercial mortgage-backed securities by risk and vintage; sovereign debt; 
and, municipal bonds. 

4.  Approach for Formulating the Macroeconomic Assumptions for Scenarios 

(a)  This section describes the Board’s approach for formulating macroeconomic 

assumptions for each scenario. The methodologies for formulating this part of each 
scenario differ by scenario, so these methodologies for the baseline and severely 
adverse scenarios are described separately in each of the following subsections. 

(b) In general, the baseline scenario will reflect the most recently available consensus 

views of the macroeconomic outlook expressed by professional forecasters, 
government agencies, and other public-sector organizations as of the beginning of the 
stress-test cycle. The severely adverse scenario will consist of a set of economic and 
financial conditions that reflect the conditions of post-war U.S. recessions. 

Page 274 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
(c)  Each of these scenarios is described further in sections below as follows: Baseline 

(subsection 4.1) and severely adverse (subsection 4.2) 

4.1 Approach for Formulating Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Baseline 
Scenario 

(a)  The stress test rules define the baseline scenario as a set of conditions that affect the U.S. 

economy or the financial condition of a banking organization, and that reflect the 
consensus views of the economic and financial outlook. Projections under a baseline 
scenario are used to evaluate how companies would perform in more likely economic and 
financial conditions. The baseline serves also as a point of comparison to the severely 
adverse scenario, giving some sense of how much of the company’s capital decline could 
be ascribed to the scenario as opposed to the company’s capital adequacy under expected 
conditions. 

(b) The baseline scenario will be developed around a macroeconomic projection that 

captures the prevailing views of private-sector forecasters (e.g., Blue Chip Consensus 
Forecasts and the Survey of Professional Forecasters), government agencies, and other 
public-sector organizations (e.g., the International Monetary Fund and the Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development) near the beginning of the annual stress-
test cycle.  The baseline scenario is designed to represent a consensus expectation of 
certain economic variables over the time period of the tests and it is not the Board’s 
internal forecast for those economic variables.  For example, the baseline path of short-
term interest rates is constructed from consensus forecasts and may differ from that 
implied by the Federal Open Market Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections. 

(c)  For some scenario variables—such as U.S. real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
the consumer price index—there will be many different forecasts available to project the 
paths of these variables in the baseline scenario. For others, a more limited number of 
forecasts will be available. If available forecasts diverge notably, the baseline scenario 
will reflect an assessment of the forecast that is deemed to be most plausible.  The Board 
also considers the output of a macroeconomic model, for which the Board will maintain a 
description separately on the Board’s website, developed by Board staff for use in 
constructing the values of some of the variables in the scenarios for the annual stress test.  
In setting the paths of variables in the baseline scenario, particular care will be taken to 
ensure that, together, the paths present a coherent and plausible outlook for the U.S. and 
global economy, given the economic climate in which they are formulated. However, the 
macroeconomic model was designed to meet the specific needs of the stress testing 
program, and the resulting baseline scenarios are not Federal Reserve forecasts. 

4.2 Approach for Formulating the Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Severely 
Adverse Scenario 

The stress test rules define a severely adverse scenario as a set of conditions that affect the U.S. 
economy or the financial condition of a financial company and that overall are significantly more 
severe than those associated with the baseline scenario. The financial company will be required 

Page 275 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to publicly disclose a summary of the results of its stress test under the severely adverse scenario, 
and the Board intends to publicly disclose the results of its analysis of the financial company 
under the severely adverse scenario. 

4.2.1 General Approach: The Recession Approach 

(a)  The Board intends to use a recession approach to develop the severely adverse scenario.  
In the recession approach, the Board will specify the future paths of variables to reflect 
conditions that characterize post-war U.S. recessions, generating either a typical or 
specific recreation of a post-war U.S. recession. The Board chose this approach because it 
has observed that the conditions that typically occur in recessions—such as increasing 
unemployment, declining asset prices, and contracting loan demand—can put significant 
stress on companies’ balance sheets. This stress can occur through a variety of channels, 
including higher loss provisions due to increased delinquencies and defaults; losses on 
trading positions through sharp moves in market prices; and lower bank income through 
reduced loan originations. For these reasons, the Board believes that the paths of 
economic and financial variables in the severely adverse scenario should, at a minimum, 
resemble the paths of those variables observed during a recession. 

(b) This approach requires consideration of the type of recession to feature. All post-war U.S. 

recessions have not been identical: Some recessions have been associated with very 
elevated interest rates, some have been associated with sizable asset price declines, and 
some have been relatively more global.  Recessions that are caused by or exacerbated by 
a financial crisis often are deeper and more protracted than other recessions. The Board 
therefore believes that the severely adverse scenario should be triggered by a sudden and 
substantial increase in risk aversion and uncertainty that causes sharp declines in risky 
financial asset prices, lower interest rates on safe assets, and a rise in volatility big 
enough to disrupt functioning in some markets. Although markets resume normal 
functioning within a few months, the rise in uncertainty and decline in wealth causes 
businesses to take nearly simultaneous steps to reduce employment and investment and 
households to reduce spending. Negative feedback effects between contracting economic 
activity and financial markets’ response lead to a deep and prolonged decline in overall 
economic activity, inflation, and asset prices followed by a shallow recovery. 

(c)  Indeed, the most common features of recessions are increases in the unemployment rate 
and contractions in aggregate incomes and economic activity. For this and the following 
reasons, the Board intends to use a rise in the unemployment rate as the primary basis for 
calibrating the severity of the severely adverse scenario. First, the unemployment rate is 
likely the most representative single summary indicator of adverse economic conditions.  
Second, in comparison to GDP, labor market data have traditionally featured more 
prominently than GDP in the set of indicators that the National Bureau of Economic 
Research reviews to inform its recession dates.297 Third and finally, the growth rate of 
potential output can cause the size of the decline in GDP to vary between recessions.  
While changes in the unemployment rate can also vary over time due to demographic 

297 More recently, a monthly measure of GDP has been added to the list of indicators. 

Page 276 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factors, this seems to have more limited implications over time relative to changes in 
potential output growth. The unemployment rate used in the severely adverse scenario 
will reflect an unemployment rate that has been observed in severe post-war U.S. 
recessions, measuring severity by the absolute level of and relative increase in the 
unemployment rate.298   

(d) The Board believes that the severely adverse scenario should also reflect a housing 
recession. The house prices path set in the severely adverse scenario will reflect 
developments that have been observed in post-war U.S. housing recessions, measuring 
severity by the absolute level of and relative decrease in the house prices. 

(e)  As described below, the Board has developed guides for several additional variables 

including equity prices, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index (VIX), 
BBB spread, mortgage rate spread, commercial real estate prices, and 5-year and 10-year 
Treasury yields. The international variables (GDP, inflation, and exchange rates) are also 
subject to guides. 

(f)  The Board will specify the paths of those other macroeconomic and financial market 

variables based on their behavior during previous recessions or other periods of financial 
stress, as well as informed assessments of how that behavior co-moved with the paths of 
unemployment, income, house prices, and activity during periods of macrofinancial 
stress. Some of these other variables, however, have taken divergent paths in previous 
recessions (e.g., foreign GDP). The analysis that the Board conducted to develop the 
guides informed its judgment in selecting the appropriate ranges for the peak or trough, 
the timing of that peak or trough, and ending values, as well as the trajectory of these 
variables between the starting and ending values. In general, the path for these variables 
also will be based on their underlying structure at the time that the scenario is designed 
(e.g., economic or financial-system vulnerabilities in other countries). 

(g) The Board considered alternative methods for scenario design of the severely adverse 
scenario, including a probabilistic approach. The probabilistic approach constructs a 
baseline forecast from a large-scale macroeconomic model and identifies a scenario that 
would have a specific probabilistic likelihood given the baseline forecast.  The Board 
believes that, at this time, the recession approach is better suited for developing the 
severely adverse scenario than a probabilistic approach because it guarantees a recession 
of some specified severity. In contrast, the probabilistic approach requires the choice of 
an extreme tail outcome—relative to baseline—to characterize the severely adverse 
scenario (e.g., a 5 percent or a 1 percent tail outcome). In practice, this choice is difficult 
as adverse economic outcomes are typically thought of in terms of how variables evolve 
in an absolute sense rather than how far away they lie in the probability space away from 

298 Even though all recessions feature increases in the unemployment rate and contractions in incomes and economic 
activity, the size of this change has varied over post-war U.S. recessions.  Table 1 documents the variability in the 
depth of post-war U.S. recessions.  Some recessions—labeled mild in Table 1—have been relatively modest, with 
GDP edging down just slightly and the unemployment rate moving up about a percentage point.  Other recessions—
labeled severe in Table 1—have been much harsher, with GDP dropping 3.75 percent and the unemployment rate 
moving up a total of about 4 percentage points. 

Page 277 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the baseline. In this sense, a scenario featuring a recession may be somewhat clearer and 
more straightforward to communicate. Finally, the probabilistic approach relies on 
estimates of uncertainty around the baseline scenario and such estimates are in practice 
model-dependent. 

4.2.2 Setting Variables in the Severely Adverse Scenario 

(a)  Generally, the variables in the severely adverse scenario will be specified to be consistent 

with their expected behavior in severe recessions or periods of market stress.  The 
approach for specifying the paths of these variables in the scenario will reflect the 
Board’s assessment of: 

(1) how economic models suggest that these variables should evolve given the path of 

the unemployment rate,  

(2) how these variables have typically evolved in past U.S. recessions or other 
relevant periods of significant stress in particular asset markets, and  

(3) other relevant factors, including the current state of the economy; the level of 
vulnerabilities in the financial system; and consensus estimates of long-run 
equilibrium values of potential GDP, interest rates, and inflation expectations. 

(b) For certain variables subject to guides that provide a range or potential values (BBB 

spread, VIX, commercial real estate prices, and mortgage rate), the Board expects that it 
could be appropriate to set the paths for these variables at similar levels of severity.  In 
making this determination, the Board would consider the expected severity of the 
unemployment rate and house prices variables and the prevailing macroeconomic and 
financial conditions described in the baseline scenario. 

(c)  The expected trajectories for the variables related to unemployment, long-term bond 

yields and spreads, asset prices, and volatility will be informed by quantitative guides.  
These guides provide plausible ranges within which the Board expects to choose the level 
of the peak or trough that each of these variables will reach in the scenario, the timing of 
that peak or trough, the value of the variable at the end of the scenario, and the trajectory 
of the variable between the starting and ending value.  The Board’s choices within those 
ranges will be informed by the factors listed in section (a), above. 

(d) Economic models—such as medium-scale macroeconomic models—should be able to 

generate plausible paths consistent with the unemployment rate for a number of scenario 
variables, such as real GDP growth, CPI inflation, and short-term interest rates, which 
have relatively stable (direct or indirect) relationships with the unemployment rate (e.g., 
Okun’s Law, the Phillips Curve, and interest rate feedback rules).  The Board has 
developed a model specifically structured and calibrated to the needs of the stress testing 
program to inform the trajectories of these variables (as well as disposable personal 
income, or DPI), a description of which will be maintained on the Board’s website.  The 
output of this model is not a forecast of the Federal Reserve.  

Page 278 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e)  In addition, judgment is necessary in projecting the path of a scenario’s international 

variables.  Recessions that occur simultaneously across countries are an important source 
of stress to the balance sheets of companies with notable international exposures but are 
not a typical feature of the international economy even when the U.S. is in recession.  As 
a result, simply adopting the typical path of international variables in a severe U.S. 
recession would likely underestimate the risks stemming from the international economy.  
Consequently, an approach that uses both judgment and economic models informs the 
path of international variables.  

(f)  The Board expects that the variables described in this section 4.2.2 will be specified in 

the annual scenarios in the severely adverse scenario to be consistent with the guides for 
each variable below.  In designing these guides and setting the values for the variables in 
the severely adverse scenario, the Board will consider the following scenario design 
principles:  

(1) Severity: The scenarios should be sufficiently severe.  Severity is an important 

component in ensuring that covered companies are adequately capitalized against 
a hypothetical severe recession and in maintaining the public credibility of stress 
tests.  In determining the adequate level of severity for these guides, the principle 
of severity requires that, at times, variable paths may exceed levels observed in 
the historical data.  Since no single scenario can account for all potential 
contingencies, the scenario must be sufficiently severe to ensure that banks will 
be resilient to a range of alternative and plausible scenarios that could generate 
net losses that are of similar magnitudes, even if such scenarios would have 
different characteristics from the single annual scenario.  In establishing a 
sufficiently severe scenario, the Board considers the potential unintended effects 
of the scenario on the operations of firms subject to the stress tests.  

(2) Credibility: The scenarios should be credible.  Credible stress tests maintain the 

confidence of the public and financial markets that the stress tests are sufficiently 
severe to ensure that the firms are properly capitalized to withstand severe 
economic and financial conditions. 

(3) Avoiding adding procyclicality: The scenarios should avoid adding sources of 
procyclicality.  If stress tests are relatively more severe in already stressed 
conditions, then this severity could add undue stress to the financial system, 
reducing financial intermediation with negative implications for the 
macroeconomy.  The stress tests should balance the need for an adequately severe 
scenario without magnifying existing procyclical tendencies in the financial 
system.   

(4) Flexibility: While the Board’s scenario design framework promotes transparency 
and predictability, fixed guides often would fail to achieve at least one of the 
Board’s goals of severity, credibility, and not adding to procyclicality, as well as 
the principles established in the Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement.299  As a 

299 12 CFR 252, Appendix B.  

Page 279 of 294 

 
 
 
 
result, the Board has designed guides in this section that generally establish 
ranges of historically observed values that can be selected for a given severely 
adverse scenario, while also enabling the Board to consider unexpected shocks 
that may have implications for the economy and the financial stability of the 
United States, and therefore, firms’ future financial condition.  Further, flexibility 
is important to enable the Board to implement reasonable technical adjustments to 
the values and trajectories of the variables, consistent with these scenario design 
principles.  

(g) The guides described in this section set out paths for each variable over the 13 quarters in 
the severely adverse scenario.  The stress test requires projections of 13 quarters’ worth 
of losses to determine capital ratios at the end of 9 quarters of the scenario, because loss 
provisions in quarter 9 are affected by bank performance in quarters 10 to 13.  To 
describe these paths, most guides adopt a simple framework involving the following 4 
parameters: 

(1) the jump-off value: the value of the variable in the quarter preceding the scenario.  

The jump-off value will be set to reflect the conditions at the time that the 
scenario is designed. 

(2) the peak or trough value: the paths in each guide specify that each variable in the 
scenario will either increase or decrease from its jump-off value.  If the variable 
increases, it will reach a maximum or peak value during the scenario.  If it 
decreases, it will reach a minimum or trough value during the scenario.   

(3) the timing of the peak or trough: the quarter of the scenario in which the variable 

path reaches its peak or trough. 

(4) the trajectory from jump-off to peak or trough: the values between the jump-off 
and peak or trough will be determined with a roughly linear interpolation, a 
nonlinear function, or by specifying the proportion of the change from jump-off to 
peak or trough that will obtain in each of the intervening quarters.  

(h) The severely adverse scenario will also set out end values and trajectories to end values. 
The end value is expected to generally be consistent with the historical values of a given 
variable within a 10 to 15 quarter window after the beginning of either a recession or 
other identified stress event. The trajectory from peak or trough to end value is expected 
to generally be determined by a roughly linear interpolation.  The trajectory from the 
peak or trough to the end value generally will be smooth for variables determined by 
guides and follow the model path for modeled variables. 

4.2.2.1 Setting the Unemployment Rate Under the Severely Adverse Scenario 

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature an unemployment 
rate peak value that increases between 3 to 5 percentage points from its jump-off value.  
However, if a 3 to 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate does not raise 
the level of the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent, the path of the unemployment 
rate in most cases will be specified so as to raise the unemployment rate to at least 10 
percent. 

Page 280 of 294 

 
 
 
 
(b) The Board anticipates that the unemployment rate peak value will occur between quarters 
6 and 8 after the jump-off point for the scenario.  The trajectory to peak value is expected 
to experience high initial changes with smaller subsequent changes quarter to quarter.   

4.2.2.2 Setting House Prices in the Severely Adverse Scenario 

(a)  In specifying the path for nominal house prices, the Board will consider the ratio of the 
nominal house price index (HPI) to nominal per capita DPI.  The Board anticipates that 
the severely adverse scenario will feature an HPI-DPI ratio that falls by at least 25 
percent, or enough to bring the ratio down to the trough reached in the first quarter of 
2012 after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 

(b) The trough is expected to occur between quarter 8 and quarter 10 after the jump-off 

quarter.  The trajectory to trough value is expected to experience 20 percent of the decline 
realized in quarter 1 and another 20 percent of the decline in quarter 2 (40 percent in 
total), with a roughly linear trajectory to trough thereafter.   

4.2.2.3 Setting the BBB Spread for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a BBB corporate 
spread value, defined as the difference between the yield on BBB corporate bonds and 
the 10-year Treasury yield, that increases to the higher of (1) between a spread level of 
500 to 600 basis points, or (2) a total increase of about 100 basis points from the jump-off 
value.   

(b) The Board anticipates that the BBB spread peak value will occur between quarters 3 and 
4 after the jump-off point for the scenario.  The trajectory to peak value is expected to 
experience the highest share of the increase in quarters 1 and 2, with between 60 and 80 
percent of the increase in quarter 1, followed by a smooth trajectory to peak thereafter.   

4.2.2.4 Setting the Mortgage Rate for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a mortgage rate 
spread value, relative to the 10-year Treasury yield, that increases between 70 to 160 
basis points from its initial level.  The initial level will be set based on the conditions at 
the time that the scenario is designed.  However, if a 70 to 160 basis point increase in the 
mortgage rate spread does not raise the level of the mortgage rate spread to at least 280 
basis points, the path of the mortgage rate spread in most cases will be specified so as to 
raise the mortgage rate spread to at least 280 basis points.   

(b) The Board anticipates that the mortgage rate spread peak value will occur between 

quarters 3 and 4 after the jump-off point for the scenario.  The trajectory to peak value is 
expected to experience between 50 and 70 percent of the increase realized in quarter 1, 
with a smooth trajectory to peak thereafter.

4.2.2.5 Setting the VIX for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a VIX peak value 

that will increase to a level between 65 and 75 percent or by at least 10 percentage points 
from the jump-off value, whichever results in a higher level. 

(b) The Board anticipates that the VIX peak value will occur in quarter 2 after the jump-off 
point for the scenario.  The trajectory to peak value is expected to experience the largest 
share of the increase, of 60 to 80 percent, in quarter 1.   

4.2.2.6 Setting Equity Prices for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature an equity price value 

that falls by around 50 percent plus or minus up to 10 percent, depending on the 
performance of equity prices over the 12-month period prior to the jump-off value.  
When equity prices have risen over the past 12 months, equity prices will fall to a trough 
level below the jump-off value of 50 percent plus one half of the percentage increase in 
equity prices up to a maximum of 10 percent. When equity prices have decreased over 
the past 12 months, equity prices will fall to a trough level below the jump-off value of 
50 percent minus one half of the percentage decrease in equity prices, up to a maximum 
of 10 percent. Thus, the equity prices reach a trough level of between 40 and 60 percent 
below the jump-off value.   

(b) The Board anticipates that the equity price trough value will occur in quarter 3 or 4 after 

the jump-off point for the scenario. The trajectory to trough value is expected to 
experience the highest share of the decrease, 60 to 70 percent, in quarter 1, with 10 to 20 
percent of the decline occurring in quarter 2 and the remaining decline realized about 
equally in the remaining quarter(s) to the trough value.   

4.2.2.7 Setting CRE prices for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a CRE price value 

that falls between 30 and 45 percent from its jump-off value. 

(b) The Board anticipates that the CRE trough value will occur between 8 and 10 quarters 

after the jump-off value for the scenario.  The trajectory to trough value is expected to be 
roughly linear.   

4.2.2.8 Setting the 5-year Treasury yield for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a 5-year Treasury 
yield value that falls between 1.5 and 3.5 percentage points from its jump-off value, 
subject to a lower bound of 0.3 percent, or a decline of 0.25 percent from the jump-off 
level, whichever is lower.   

Page 282 of 294 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
(b) The Board anticipates that the 5-year Treasury yield trough value will occur between 1 

and 4 quarters after the jump-off value for the scenario.  The trajectory to trough value is 
expected to experience the highest share of the decrease in quarter 1, depending on the 
quarter that the trough value will occur, such that the share of the decrease in quarter 1 
will be between 55 percent and 100 percent.  If the trough value is set to occur in quarters 
2, 3, or 4, the yield decline trajectory following quarter 1 will decrease smoothly to the 
trough quarter.  

4.2.2.9 Setting the 10-year Treasury yield for the Severely Adverse Scenario  

(a)  The Board anticipates that the severely adverse scenario will feature a 10-year Treasury 
yield value that falls between 1 and 3 percentage points from its jump-off value, subject 
to a lower bound of 0.5 percent, or a decline of 0.25 percent from the jump-off level, 
whichever is lower.   

(b) The Board anticipates that the 10-year Treasury yield trough value will occur between 1 
and 4 quarters after the jump-off value for the scenario.  The trajectory to trough value is 
expected to experience the highest share of the decrease in quarter 1, depending on the 
quarter that the trough value will occur, such that the share of the decrease in quarter 1 
will be between 55 percent and 100 percent.  If the trough value is set as quarters 2, 3, or 
4, the yield decline trajectory following quarter 1 will decrease smoothly to the trough 
quarter.  

4.2.2.10 Setting the Calibration of International Variables  

(a)  The Board expects to calibrate values for certain international variables in the euro area, 

the United Kingdom, Japan, and Developing Asia.  

(b) For the euro area, the Board expects in general to specify that GDP will decline by 7.5 

percent from the baseline value to its trough in the scenario, and reach an end value of 7.5 
percent below the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value for the 
decline in GDP between 5 and 10 percent.  The Board expects to specify that euro area 
inflation will decline by 3 percentage points from the baseline scenario to its trough, and 
reach an end value of 0 percentage points below the baseline value.  However, the Board 
may choose a value for the decline in inflation between 2 and 4 percentage points.  The 
Board expects to specify that the U.S. dollar will appreciate against the euro by 
approximately 15 percent from its jump-off value at its peak and then revert back to the 
jump-off value by the end of the scenario.  However, the Board may choose a value for 
U.S. dollar appreciation between 5 and 25 percent. 

(c)  For the United Kingdom, the Board expects in general to specify that GDP will decline 
by 7.5 percent from the baseline value to its trough in the scenario, and reach an end 
value of 7.5 percent below the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value 

Page 283 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the decline in GDP between 5 and 10 percent.  The Board expects to specify that 
inflation will decline by 3 percentage points from the baseline value to its trough, and 
reach an end value of 0 percentage points below the baseline value.  However, the Board 
may choose a value for the decline in inflation between 2 and 4 percentage points.  The 
Board expects to specify that the U.S. dollar will appreciate against the Great Britain 
Pound by 15 percent from its jump-off value at its peak and then revert back to the jump-
off value by the end of the scenario.  However, the Board may choose a value for U.S. 
dollar appreciation between 5 and 25 percent. 

(d) For Japan, the Board expects in general to specify that GDP will decline by 7.5 percent 

from the baseline value to its trough in the scenario, and reach an end value of 7.5 percent 
below the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value for the decline in 
GDP between 5 and 10 percent.  The Board expects to specify that inflation will decline 
by 3 percentage points from the baseline value to its trough, and reach an end value of 0 
percentage points below the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value for 
the decline in inflation between 2 and 4 percentage points.  The Board expects to specify 
that U.S. dollar will depreciate against the Japanese yen by 1 percent from its jump-off 
value at its peak and then revert back to the jump-off value by the end of the scenario.  
However, the Board may choose a value for change in value of the U.S. dollar against the 
Japanese yen ranging from a 9 percent depreciation to an 11 percent appreciation. 

(e)  For Developing Asia, the Board expects in general to specify that GDP will decline by 3 
percent from the baseline value to its trough, and reach an end value of 0 percent below 
the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value for the decline in GDP 
between 0.5 and 5.5 percent.  The Board expects to specify that inflation will decline by 5 
percentage points from the baseline value to its trough, and reach an end value of 0 
percentage points below the baseline value.  However, the Board may choose a value for 
the decline in inflation between 0.8 and 9 percentage points.  The Board expects to 
specify that the U.S. dollar will appreciate against the currencies in Developing Asia by 
15 percent from its jump-off value at its peak and then revert back to the jump-off value 
by the end of the scenario.  However, the Board may choose a value for the appreciation 
of the U.S. dollar between 5 and 25 percent. 

4.2.3 Adding Salient Risks to the Severely Adverse Scenario 

(a)  The severely adverse scenario will be developed to reflect specific risks to the economic 
and financial outlook that are especially salient but that would feature minimally in the 
scenario if the Board were to use only approaches that looked to past recessions or relied 
on historical relationships between variables. 

(b) There are some important instances in which it will be appropriate to augment the 

recession approach with salient risks.  For example, if an asset price were especially 
elevated and thus potentially vulnerable to an abrupt and potentially destabilizing decline, 
it would be appropriate to include such a decline in the scenario even if such a large drop 
were not typical in a severe recession.  Likewise, if economic developments abroad were 

Page 284 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
particularly unfavorable, assuming a weakening in international conditions larger than 
what typically occurs in severe U.S. recessions would likely also be appropriate. 

(c)  Clearly, while the recession component of the severely adverse scenario is within some 

predictable range, the salient risk aspect of the scenario is far less so, and therefore, needs 
an annual assessment.  Each year, the Board will identify the risks to the financial system 
and the domestic and international economic outlooks that appear more elevated than 
usual, using its internal analysis and supervisory information and in consultation with the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC).  Using the same information, the Board will then calibrate the paths of 
the macroeconomic and financial variables in the scenario to reflect these risks. 

(d) The Board will factor in particular risks to the domestic and international macroeconomic 
outlook identified by its economists, bank supervisors, and financial market experts and 
make appropriate adjustments to the paths of specific economic variables.  These 
adjustments will not be reflected in the general severity of the recession and, thus, all 
macroeconomic variables; rather, the adjustments will apply to a subset of variables to 
reflect co-movements in these variables that are historically less typical.  The Board plans 
to discuss the motivation for the adjustments that it makes to variables to highlight 
systemic risks in the narrative describing the scenarios, which will be released for public 
comment and subsequently adjusted, if necessary, in response to those comments.300 

5.  Approach for Formulating the Market Shock Component 

(a)  This section discusses the approach the Board proposes to adopt for developing the 

market shock component of the severely adverse scenario appropriate for companies 
with significant trading activities.  The design and specification of the market shock 
component differs from that of the macroeconomic scenarios because profits and 
losses from trading are measured in mark-to-market terms, while revenues and losses 
from traditional banking are generally measured using the accrual method.  As noted 
above, another critical difference is the time-evolution of the market shock component. 
The market shock component consists of a sudden “shock” to a large number of risk 
factors that determine the mark-to-market value of trading positions, while the 
macroeconomic scenarios supply a projected path of economic variables that affect 
traditional banking activities over the entire planning period. 

300  The means of effecting an adjustment to the severely adverse scenario to address salient 
systemic risks differs from the means used to adjust variables within the ranges specified by the 
guides or the paths suggested by the macroeconomic model.  For example, in adjusting the 
scenario for an increased unemployment rate, the Board would modify all variables such that the 
future paths of the variables would be similar to how these variables have moved historically in 
response to a change in the unemployment rate.  In contrast, to address salient risks, the Board 
may only modify a small number of variables in the scenario and, as such, their future paths in 
the scenario would be somewhat more atypical, but not implausible, given existing risks. 

Page 285 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
(b) The development of the market shock component that are detailed in this section are as 

follows: baseline (subsection 5.1) and severely adverse (subsection 5.2). 

5.1 Approach for Formulating the Market Shock Component Under the Baseline 
Scenario 

Market shocks are large, previously unanticipated moves in asset prices and rates.  Under the 
baseline scenario, asset prices should, broadly speaking, reflect consensus opinions about the 
future evolution of the economy.  Sudden price movements, as envisioned in the market shock, 
should not occur along the baseline path.  As a result, the market shock will not be included in 
the baseline scenario. 

5.2 Approach for Formulating the Market Shock Component Under the Severely 
Adverse Scenario 

This section addresses possible approaches to designing the market shock component in the 
severely adverse scenario, including important considerations for scenario design, possible 
approaches to designing scenarios, and a development strategy for implementing the preferred 
approach. 

5.2.1 Design Considerations for Market Shocks 

(a)  The general market practice for stressing a trading portfolio is to specify market shocks 
either in terms of changes to observable, broad financial market indicators and risk 
factors or directly as changes to the mark-to-market values of financial instruments.  

(b) While the number of market shocks used in companies’ pricing and stress-testing models 
typically exceeds that provided in the Board’s scenarios, the number of market shocks in 
the Board’s scenarios allows for the consistency and comparability of market losses 
across companies.  However, the benefit from specifying a large set of market shocks is 
at least partly offset by the potential difficulty in creating shocks that are coherent and 
internally consistent, particularly as the framework for developing market shocks 
deviates from historical events.  The Board’s process for generating the scenario market 
shocks has developed over time to rely less on models and has expanded its use of 
simpler methods, such as multipliers and mappings to modeled risk factors.  

(c)  Also, importantly, the ultimate losses associated with a given market shock will depend 
on a company’s trading positions, which can make it difficult to rank order, ex ante, the 
severity of the scenarios.  In certain instances, market shocks that include large market 
moves may not be particularly stressful for a given company.  Aligning the market shock 
with the macroeconomic scenario for consistency may result in certain companies 
actually benefiting from risk factor moves of larger magnitude in the market scenario if 

Page 286 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the companies are hedging against salient risks to other parts of their business.  Thus, the 
severity of market shocks must be calibrated to take into account how a complex set of 
risks, such as directional risks and basis risks, interacts with each other, given the 
companies’ trading positions at the time of stress.  For instance, a large depreciation in a 
foreign currency would benefit companies with net short positions in the currency while 
hurting those with net long positions.  In addition, longer maturity positions may move 
differently from shorter maturity positions, adding further complexity. 

(d) The sudden nature of market shocks and the early recognition of mark-to-market losses 
add another element to the design of market shocks, and to determining the appropriate 
severity of shocks.  The design of the market shocks must factor in appropriate 
assumptions around the period of time during which market events will unfold and any 
associated market responses. 

(e)  The design of market shocks includes calibration of shock magnitudes based on assumed 
time horizons that reflect several scenario design considerations.  One consideration is 
the liquidity characteristics of different asset classes.  More specifically, the calibration 
horizons reflect the variation in speed at which banks could reasonably close out, or 
effectively hedge, the associated risk exposures in the event of a market stress.  The 
horizons are generally longer than the typical times needed to liquidate exposures under 
normal conditions because they are designed to capture the unpredictable liquidity 
conditions that prevail in times of stress.  Another consideration is maintaining 
consistency between the assumed time horizons used to calibrate market shocks and the 
timeline for attributing the losses stemming from them.  Specifically, losses associated 
with the global market shock component are attributed in one quarter of the stress test 
horizon, which implies an upper bound of three months for calibrating the shocks.  

(f)  Given these considerations, shock liquidity horizons are chosen to be broadly consistent 
with the proposed standards in the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB).  
The horizons in the FRTB are specified based on recommendations from consultations 
with the financial industry and its regulators.  The horizons in the FRTB are therefore 
considered a reasonable benchmark for defining the shock horizons used in the global 
market shock.  The liquidity horizons used in the market shock scenarios are not expected 
to be perfectly matched with the FRTB liquidity horizons due to granularity differences 
between the FRTB standards and the global market shock template.  The FRTB specifies 
horizons at a more granular level, often using different horizons within each asset class, 
whereas the Board uses the same liquidity horizon for all market shocks within each asset 
class.  Given these differences, the global market shock scenario aims to align with the 
horizons specified by the FRTB by using a weighted average of the FRTB horizons 
within each asset class.  The weights are determined using aggregate firm exposures.  For 
example, FRTB horizons for equity risk factors vary between 10 and 60 business days, 
and the global market shock horizon for this asset class is assumed to be 4 weeks.  
Because the Board imposes an upper bound on global market shock horizons of one 

Page 287 of 294 

 
 
 
 
quarter, there are cases where in which the range of FRTB horizons is longer than the 
global market shock horizon.  For example, FRTB horizons for corporate credit market 
shocks vary between 60 and 120 business days, but the Board uses a horizon of 3 months 
for corporate credit. 

5.2.2 Approaches to Market Shock Design 

(a)  As an additional component of the severely adverse scenario, the Board plans to use a 
standardized set of market shocks that apply to all companies with significant trading 
activity.  The market shocks could be based on a single historical episode, hypothetical 
(but plausible) events, or some combination of historical episodes, with or without the 
addition of hypothetical events (hybrid approach).  Depending on the type of hypothetical 
events, a scenario based on such events may result in changes in risk factors that were not 
previously observed.  

(b) For the market shock component in the severely adverse scenario, the Board plans to use 

the hybrid approach to develop shocks.  The hybrid approach allows the Board to 
maintain certain core elements of consistency in market shocks each year while providing 
flexibility to add hypothetical elements based on market conditions at the time of the 
stress tests.  In addition, this approach will help ensure internal consistency in the 
scenario because of its basis in historical episodes; however, combining the historical 
episode and hypothetical events may require some adjustments to ensure mutual 
consistency of the joint moves.  In general, the hybrid approach provides considerable 
flexibility in developing scenarios that are relevant each year, and by introducing 
variations in the scenario, the approach will also reduce the ability of companies with 
significant trading activity to modify or shift their portfolios to minimize expected losses 
in the severely adverse market shock. 

(c)  The Board has considered a number of alternative approaches for the design of market 

shocks.  For example, the Board explored an option of providing tailored market shocks 
for each trading company, using information on the companies’ portfolios gathered 
through ongoing supervision, or other means.  By specifically targeting known or 
potential vulnerabilities in a company’s trading position, the tailored approach would be 
useful in assessing each company’s capital adequacy as it relates to the company’s 
idiosyncratic risk.  However, the Board does not believe this approach to be well-suited 
for the stress tests required by regulation.  Consistency and comparability are key features 
of annual supervisory stress tests and annual company-run stress tests required in the 
stress test rules.  It would be difficult to use the information on the companies’ portfolios 
to design a common set of shocks that are universally stressful for all covered companies.  
As a result, this approach would be better suited to more customized, tailored stress tests 
that are part of the company’s internal capital planning process or to other supervisory 
efforts outside of the stress tests conducted under the capital rule and the stress test rules. 

Page 288 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
5.2.3 Development of the Market Shock 

(a)  Consistent with the approach described above, the market shock component for the 

severely adverse scenario will incorporate key elements of market developments during 
historical periods of stress, and may include other price and rate movements in certain 
markets that the Board deems to be plausible, though such movements may not have been 
observed historically.  

(b) The Board will identify potential market stress scenarios, based on multiple sources of 
information, including financial stability reports, supervisory information, and internal 
and external assessments of market risks and potential flash points.  The hypothetical 
elements could originate from major geopolitical, economic, or financial market events 
with potentially significant impacts on market risk factors.  The severity of these 
hypothetical moves will likely be guided by similar historical events, assumptions 
embedded in the companies’ internal stress tests or market participants, and other 
available information. 

(c)  Once broad market scenarios are agreed upon, the implications for key risk factor groups 
will be defined.  For example, a scenario involving the failure of a large, interconnected 
globally active financial institution could begin with a sharp increase in credit default 
swap spreads and a precipitous decline in asset prices across multiple markets, as 
investors become more risk averse and market liquidity evaporates.  These broad market 
movements will be extrapolated to the granular level for all risk factors by examining 
transmission channels and the historical relationships between variables, though in some 
cases, the movement in particular risk factors may be amplified based on theoretical 
relationships, market observations, or the saliency to company trading books.  If there is a 
disagreement between the risk factor movements in the historical event used in the 
scenario and the hypothetical event, the Board will reconcile the differences by assessing 
a priori expectations based on financial and economic theory and the importance of the 
risk factors to the trading positions of the firms. 

6.  Consistency Between the Macroeconomic Scenarios and the Market Shock 

(a)  As discussed earlier, the market shock comprises a set of movements in a large 

number of risk factors that are realized in the first quarter of the stress test horizon.  
Among the risk factors specified in the market shock are several variables also 
specified in the macroeconomic scenarios, such as short- and long-maturity interest 
rates on Treasury and corporate debt, the level and volatility of U.S. stock prices, and 
exchange rates. 

(b) The market shock component is an add-on to the macroeconomic scenarios that 

reflects abrupt market disruptions.  As a result, the market shock component may not 

Page 289 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
always be directionally consistent with the macroeconomic scenario.  Because the 
market shock is designed, in part, to mimic the effects of a sudden market dislocation, 
while the macroeconomic scenarios are designed to provide a description of the 
evolution of the real economy over two or more years, assumed economic conditions 
can move in significantly different ways.  In effect, the market shock can simulate a 
market panic, during which financial asset prices move rapidly in unexpected 
directions, and the macroeconomic assumptions can simulate the severe recession that 
follows.  Indeed, the pattern of a financial crisis, characterized by a short period of 
wild swings in asset prices followed by a prolonged period of moribund activity, and a 
subsequent severe recession is familiar and plausible. 

(c)  As discussed in section 4.2.3, the Board may feature a particularly salient risk in the 
macroeconomic assumptions for the severely adverse scenario, such as a fall in an 
elevated asset price.  In such instances, the Board may also seek to reflect same risk in 
the market shock.  For example, if the macroeconomic scenario were to feature a 
substantial decline in house prices, it may be plausible for the market shock to feature 
a significant decline in market values of any securities that are closely tied to the 
housing sector or residential mortgages. 

7.   Timeline for Scenario Publication 

(a)  The Board will provide a final description of the macroeconomic scenarios by no later 
than February 15.  During the period immediately preceding the publication of the 
scenarios, the Board will collect and consider information from academics, 
professional forecasters, international organizations, domestic and foreign supervisors, 
and other private-sector analysts that regularly conduct stress tests based on U.S. and 
global economic and financial scenarios, including analysts at the firms.  In addition, 
the Board will consult with the FDIC and the OCC on setting the guides in the 
scenarios.  The Board expects to conduct this process each year and disclose the 
developed scenarios for public comment.  The Board will update the scenarios, based 
on the public comments and incoming macroeconomic data releases and other 
information. 

(b) The Board expects to provide a broad overview of the market shock component along 

with the macroeconomic scenarios.  The Board will publish the market shock 
templates by no later than March 1 of each year, and intends to publish the market 
shock earlier in the stress test and capital plan cycles to allow companies more time to 
conduct their stress tests.

Appendix B to Part 252—Stress Testing Policy Statement 

19. To amend appendix B to part 252: 

a. Add paragraph (a)(iv) to section 2.1; 

b. Revise section 2.2; 

c. Remove the text “and non-public information about” from section 3.1; 

d. Revise paragraph (c) of section 3.2. 

The revisions read as follows:

2.1 Soundness in Model Design  

(a) During development, the Federal Reserve  

(i) subjects supervisory models to extensive review of model theory and logic and general 
conceptual soundness;  

(ii) examines and evaluates justifications for modeling assumptions; 

(iii) tests models to establish the accuracy and stability of the estimates and forecasts that they 
produce; and 

(iv) invites, evaluates, and responds to substantive public input on material model changes. 

* 

*

2.2. Disclosure of Information Related to the Supervisory Stress Test  

(a) In general, the Board does not disclose information related to the supervisory stress test to 
covered companies if that information is not also publicly disclosed.  However, the Board will 
generally provide additional information directly to a covered company about such covered 
company’s supervisory stress test results, provided that the Board will only do so if it provides 
the same type of information to all other covered companies participating in the same stress test 
cycle.  

(b) The Board has increased the breadth of its public disclosure since the inception of the 
supervisory stress test to include comprehensive descriptions of the supervisory stress models, 
changes to those models, and, for each supervisory stress test cycle, more information about 

Page 293 of 294 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model changes and key risk drivers, in addition to more detail on different components of 
projected net revenues and losses. Increasing public disclosure can help the public understand 
and interpret the results of the supervisory stress test, particularly with respect to the condition 
and capital adequacy of participating firms. Providing additional information about the 
supervisory stress test allows the public to make an evaluation of the quality of the Board’s 
assessment. This policy also promotes consistent and equitable treatment of covered companies 
by ensuring that institutions do not have access to information about the supervisory stress test 
that is not also accessible to other covered companies, corresponding to the principle of 
consistency and comparability.

* 

* 

* 

* 

(b) In addition, the Model Validation Council, a council of external academic experts, provides 
independent advice on the Federal Reserve’s process to assess models used in the supervisory 
stress test. In biannual meetings with Federal Reserve officials, members of the council discuss 
selective supervisory models, after being provided with detailed model documentation for those 
models. The documentation and discussions enable the council to assess the effectiveness of the 
models used in the supervisory stress tests and of the overarching model validation program. 

 * 

* 

* 

* 

* 

3.2. Technical Competence of Validation Staff 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

(c) The model validation program covers three main areas of validation:  

(1) Conceptual soundness;  

(2) ongoing monitoring; and  

(3) outcomes analysis.  

Validation staff evaluates all aspects of model development, implementation, and use, including 
but not limited to theory, design, methodology, input data, testing, performance, documentation 
standards, implementation controls (including access and change controls), and code verification.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The supervisory stress tests conducted annually by the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (Board) help ensure that large banks are able to lend to households and 

businesses even in a severe recession.  The stress tests evaluate the financial resilience of large 

banks by estimating bank losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital levels—which provide 

2 

 
a cushion against losses—under hypothetical recession scenarios into the future.1  The Board 

uses the results of a stress test, in part, to set large bank capital requirements. 

To enhance the transparency of the annual stress tests and to seek public feedback, the 

Board is inviting comment on the proposed stress test scenarios for the 2026 supervisory stress 

test.  These proposed scenarios, as well as supporting models and data, are available on the 

Board’s website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm. 

Separately, the Board is seeking comment on an enhanced disclosure process under 

which the Board would publish and seek comment on the scenarios by October 15 of each year.  

1 U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), covered savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs), and intermediate 
holding companies of foreign banking organizations (IHCs) with $100 billion or more in assets are subject to the 
Board’s supervisory stress test rule (12 CFR part 238, subpart O; 12 CFR part 252, subpart E) and capital planning 
requirements (12 CFR 225.8; 12 CFR 238.170).  In addition, certain BHCs, SLHCs, IHCs, and state member banks 
must comply with the Board’s company-run stress test rules (12 CFR part 238, subpart P; and 12 CFR part 252, 
subparts B and F).

Preface

The Federal Reserve promotes a safe, sound, and efficient banking system that supports the

U.S. economy through its supervision and regulation of domestic and foreign banks.

As part of its supervision efforts and as required by the Dodd Frank Act, the Federal Reserve
annually conducts a stress test.1 The stress test assesses how large banks are likely to perform
under hypothetical economic conditions.2

The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests to help ensure that large banks are sufficiently capital-

ized and able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. They evaluate the

financial resilience of banks by estimating losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital levels

under hypothetical economic conditions.

As part of the annual supervisory stress test cycle, the Federal Reserve publishes four

documents:

• Stress Test Scenarios describes the hypothetical economic conditions used in the supervisory

stress test. The Stress Test Scenarios document is typically published by mid-February.

• Stress Test Methodology provides details about the models and methodologies used in the

supervisory stress test. The Supervisory Stress Test Methodology document is typically pub-

lished at the end of the first quarter.

• Federal Reserve Stress Test Results reports the aggregate and individual bank results of the

supervisory stress test, which assesses whether banks are sufficiently capitalized to absorb

losses during a hypothetical severe recession. The Federal Reserve Stress Test Results docu-

ment is typically published at the end of the second quarter.

• Large Bank Capital Requirements announces the individual capital requirement for all large

banks, which are partially informed by the results of a supervisory stress test. The Large Bank

Capital Requirements document is typically published during the third quarter.

These publications can be found on the Stress Test Publications page (https://

www.federalreserve.gov/publications/dodd-frank-act-stress-test-publications.htm).

Executive Summary

The Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests help ensure that large banks are able to lend to

households and businesses even in a severe recession. The stress tests evaluate the financial

resilience of large banks by estimating bank losses, revenues, expenses, and resulting capital

levels—which provide a cushion against losses—under hypothetical recession scenarios into the
future.3 The Federal Reserve uses the results of a stress test, in part, to set large bank capital

requirements.

The proposed 2026 severely adverse scenario is informed by the analysis supporting the Board’s

proposed update (the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement) to its 2019 Policy State-

ment on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing (the 2019 Scenario Design Policy
Statement).4 The Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement makes the design of the

supervisory severely adverse scenario more transparent by narrowing the ranges of potential

values for certain variables through proposed additional guides. The 2026 scenario reflects three

enhancements to scenario design, as set forth in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy

Statement, that are intended to describe more clearly to the public how the Board determines the

trajectory of variables within the macroeconomic scenario.

First, the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement expands the number and scope of

guides used for certain scenario variables. The Board proposes to enhance the two existing

guides, already outlined in the 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement, for the unemployment rate

and house price scenario variables, and the proposal describes newly developed guides for addi-

tional domestic and international scenario variables. The proposed 2026 severely adverse sce-

nario is consistent with the guides in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement.

Second, the Board is publishing a new, small-scale macroeconomic model of the U.S. economy

that will be used for Stress Testing (hereafter, the “macro model for Stress Testing”), which is
described in detail on the Board’s website.5 The model will be used to determine the values of

gross domestic product (GDP), per capita disposable personal income (DPI), inflation, and certain

parts of the trajectory of interest rates that are internally consistent with the guide-based change

in unemployment and other factors described in the model documentation. This new model is set

3 As noted, BHCs, SLHCs, and IHCs with $100 billion or more in assets are subject to the Board’s supervisory stress test
rule (12 CFR pt. 238, subpt. O; 12 CFR pt. 252, subpt. E) and capital planning requirements (12 CFR § 225.8; 12 CFR
§ 238.170). In addition, certain BHCs, SLHCs, IHCs, and state member banks must comply with the Board’s
company-run stress test rules (12 CFR pt. 238, subpt. P; and 12 CFR pt. 252, subpts. B and F).

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

forth in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement and has been specifically structured

and calibrated to fulfill the needs of the stress testing program. As such, the variable paths pre-

scribed by it should not be interpreted as economic forecasts of the Board or the Federal Open

Market Committee (FOMC). Prior scenario paths for these variables were informed by a similar

modeling structure with the outputs adjusted using the Board’s expert judgment and experience to

align with the scenario narrative.

Third, the Board is publishing the model used to generate the global market shock (the

GMS model). The Board invites comment on both the macro model for Stress Testing and the

GMS model as part of this notice. 

The 2026 severely adverse scenario is characterized by a hypothetical severe global recession

triggered by an abrupt decline in risk appetite that causes substantial declines in the prices of
risky assets, declines in risk-free interest rates and high levels of financial market volatility.6

Equity prices fall about 54 percent in the first three quarters of the scenario while the U.S. Market

Volatility Index (VIX) spikes and reaches a peak of 72 percent in the second quarter of the sce-

nario. Those conditions also lead to a widening in corporate bond spreads to a level of 5.7 per-

centage points. The ensuing disruptions depress demand for goods and services from households

and prompt businesses to dramatically reduce employment and investment, conditions from which

the economy and asset prices are slow to recover. The U.S. unemployment rate rises 5.5 per-

centage points from the scenario’s jump-off point of 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to

its peak of 10 percent in the third quarter of 2027. The sharp decline in economic activity leads to

a collapse in real estate prices, including a 29 percent decline in nominal house prices and a

40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices. The international portion of the scenario fea-

tures recessions in three countries or country blocs and a sharp slowdown in developing Asia, and

declines in inflation, with all countries or country blocs experiencing deflation. The value of the

U.S. dollar appreciates against all countries and country blocs’ currencies, except for the Japa-

nese yen, as discussed below. For more information, please see “Details of the Severely Adverse

Scenario.”

As provided under the Board’s stress test rule, banks with large trading operations are tested

against a global market shock component that stresses their trading and certain other fair-valued
positions.7 Furthermore, banks with substantial trading or custodial operations are tested against
the default of their largest counterparty.8 As noted before, these hypothetical scenarios are not

economic forecasts. Their components are described in additional detail in this publication.

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

The severely adverse scenario describes a hypothetical set of conditions designed to assess the

strength and resilience of banks in an adverse economic environment. Meanwhile, the baseline

scenario follows a profile similar to that of average projections from a survey of economic fore-

casters. These scenarios are not Federal Reserve forecasts.

The scenarios start in the first quarter of 2026 and extend through the first quarter of 2029. Each

scenario includes 28 variables; the set of variables for the 2026 supervisory stress test is the

same as the set provided in last year’s supervisory stress test scenarios. The variables describing

economic developments within the United States include:

• Six measures of economic activity and prices: quarterly percent changes (at an annualized

rate) in real and nominal GDP, real and nominal disposable personal income, the Consumer

Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI), and the unemployment rate of the civilian non-

institutional population aged 16 years and over.

• Four aggregate measures of asset prices or financial conditions: indexes of house prices,

commercial real estate prices, equity prices, and stock market volatility.

• Six measures of interest rates: the rate on 3-month Treasury securities; the yield on 5-year

Treasury securities; the yield on 10-year Treasury securities; the yield on 10-year BBB-rated cor-

porate securities; the interest rate associated with conforming, conventional, 30-year fixed-rate

mortgages; and the prime rate.

The variables describing international economic conditions in each scenario include three vari-

ables in four countries or country blocs:

• The three variables for each country or country bloc: quarterly percent changes (at an annual

rate) in real GDP and in consumer price indexes or local equivalent, and the level of the

U.S. dollar exchange rate.

• Four countries or country blocs: the euro area (the 20 European Union member states that

have adopted the euro as their common currency); the United Kingdom; developing Asia (the

nominal GDP-weighted aggregate of China, India, South Korea, Hong Kong Special Administra-

tive Region, and Taiwan); and Japan.

4

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

Question 1: The Board invites comment on all aspects of the scenario proposal, including the

substantive components of the proposed scenario, the utility of the proposed scenario’s format and

contents to the public, and whether the length of the public comment period is sufficient to allow the

public to comment within the annual stress test cycle.

Baseline and Severely Adverse Scenarios

The following sections describe this year’s proposed baseline and severely adverse scenarios. The
variables included in these scenarios are provided in tables at the end of this document.9 His-

torical data for the domestic and the international variables are reported in tables 1.A and 1.B,

respectively.

The scenario jump-off quarter is set as the fourth quarter of 2025, and the scenario begins in the

first quarter of 2026. Given that many of the relevant data points are not yet available for the

second, third, or fourth quarters of 2025, estimates for scenario variables for those quarters are

constructed using the same methodology used to generate the baseline scenario. The estimates

for those quarters will be replaced in the final 2026 scenario with published values after they

become available. Estimates will similarly be constructed for any data for the fourth quarter of

2025 that will not be available at publication in February 2026, as has been the case in past sce-

narios. With new data, the jump-off values for the scenarios will change. Accordingly, the scenario

paths will change based on these new jump-off values. For more details, see “Methodology to

Update the Scenarios to Incorporate Additional Data Releases.”

Baseline Scenario

The proposed 2026 baseline scenario for U.S. real activity, inflation, and interest rates (see

table 2.A) is similar to the consensus projections from the September 2025 Blue Chip Financial

Forecasts released on August 29, 2025, and the August 2025 Blue Chip Economic Indicators
released on August 11, 2025.10 The long-term components of the baseline scenario for U.S. real

activity, inflation, and interest rates are similar to the March 2025 Blue Chip release. The pro-

posed baseline scenario paths for the other scenario variables are constructed according to the

macro model for Stress Testing discussed in the Board’s Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy

Statement. This scenario is not a forecast of the Federal Reserve.

The baseline scenario for the United States features moderate economic growth. The unemploy-

ment rate moves up to 4.6 percent in the first quarter of 2026, and stays at that level until the

third quarter of 2026, before gradually declining to 4.2 percent in the third quarter of 2028, where

it remains through the end of the scenario. Real GDP growth rises from 0.8 percent in the fourth

quarter of 2025 to 2 percent by the first quarter of 2027 and hovers around that rate for the rest

of the scenario. Inflation, measured as the quarterly change in the CPI and reported as an annual-

ized rate, gradually declines from 3.4 percent at the end of 2025 to 2.2 percent in the first

quarter of 2027, where it remains through the end of the scenario. The 3-month Treasury rate

decreases from 4.0 percent at the end of 2025 to 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2026, after

which it declines to 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2026. It remains there through the first

quarter of 2028, after which it gradually declines to 3.1 percent through the end of the scenario.

The 10-year Treasury yield ticks down from 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 4.2 per-

cent in the first quarter of 2026 and then declines gradually to 3.9 percent by the end of the sce-

nario. The prime rate follows a path similar to short-term interest rates, but sits at a level 3 per-

centage points higher, reflecting the typical spread between the prime rate and the top of the
federal funds target range.11 Mortgage rates decline gradually from 6.4 percent at the end of

2025 to 5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2028 where they remain for the rest of the scenario.

Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds hover around their level in the fourth quarter of 2025

throughout the scenario, while the spread between yields on BBB-rated bonds and yields on

10-year Treasury securities increases gradually to a level of 1.6 percentage points by the third

quarter of 2027 and remains around that level through the rest of the scenario.

Equity prices increase about 4.3 percent per year throughout the scenario. Equity market volatility,

as measured by the VIX, increases gradually from 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to

25 percent in the third quarter of 2027, where it remains through the end of the scenario. Nominal

house prices decline somewhat through the first quarter of 2027 before gradually increasing

through the remainder of the scenario, while commercial real estate prices increase about 4.3 per-

cent per year.

The baseline paths for the international variables (see table 2.B) are similar to the trajectories

reported in the August 2025 Blue Chip Economic Indicators and the International Monetary Fund’s
April 2025 World Economic Outlook.12 In the baseline scenario, real GDP growth in developing Asia

increases from 2.8 percent to 5.6 percent in the third quarter of 2026, after which it gradually

declines to 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2027. It then fluctuates between 4.8 percent and

4.2 percent through the end of the scenario. Real GDP growth in the euro area increases from

0.3 percent at the end of 2025 to 2 percent by the third quarter of 2026. It then declines gradu-

ally to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2027, after which it fluctuates between 1.2 percent

and 1.5 percent through the end of the scenario. Real GDP growth in the United Kingdom

increases from 0.4 percent at the end of 2025 to 1.8 percent by the third quarter of 2026, after

which it gradually declines to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2027. It then fluctuates

between 1.2 and 1.4 through the end of the scenario. GDP growth in Japan begins at negative

0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 and increases to 1.8 percent in the third quarter of

2026. It then gradually declines to 0.2 percent through the third quarter of 2027, after which it

hovers between 0.4 percent and 1.1 percent through the end of the scenario.

Consumer price inflation in the euro area increases from 1.8 percent to 2 percent in the second

quarter of 2027 and hovers around that level for the rest of the scenario. Consumer price inflation

in the United Kingdom declines from 2.7 percent to 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2026 and

hovers around that level through the end of the scenario. Inflation in Japan increases from

1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 2028, where it

remains through the end of the scenario. The inflation rate in developing Asia increases gradually

from 1.3 percent to 2.2 percent by the third quarter of 2027 and hovers around there for the rest

of the scenario.

Question 2: The Board invites comment on all aspects of the proposed baseline scenario.

Severely Adverse Scenario

As noted, the proposed 2026 severely adverse scenario is informed by the Board’s Proposed
2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement.13 Additionally, the guides described in the Proposed

2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement, the macro model for Stress Testing, and the proposed

2026 scenario that the Board has constructed based on that framework, are consistent with the
Board’s 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement.14 While this proposal is designed to provide

more transparency around the Board’s process and decisions, the Board expects that the resulting

scenarios will, on balance, be similar to those that it has used in prior annual stress test

exercises.

In accordance with the Board’s Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement, the Board’s sce-

nario design approach is informed by current macroeconomic and financial conditions, which are

summarized here for the purposes of the design of the proposed severely adverse scenario. The

current unemployment rate is near the consensus forecast of the long-run natural unemployment

rate in the March 2025 Blue Chip Economic Indicators. As discussed in the previous section, the

proposed 2026 baseline scenario paths for GDP growth and inflation see GDP growth rising and
inflation remaining somewhat above the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal.15 Equity prices

in the proposed baseline scenario are projected to have increased 7 percent from the end of last

year through the fourth quarter of 2025 and about 30 percent over the past two years. While

house prices have remained largely flat over the past two years, they are about 34 percent higher

than their level five years ago. Commercial real estate prices have changed little since early 2024

after significant declines in 2023, and the BBB spread remains low relative to its historical series.

This summary of current macroeconomic and financial conditions should not be interpreted as an

assessment of likely future developments but informs the design of the proposed severely

adverse scenario, consistent with the Board’s expectation that scenario severity generally will be

higher during economic expansions or periods when asset values have increased or to avoid

adding sources of procyclicality through the stress test.

In the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement, the guides for the scenario variables

include ranges for the values controlling certain features of the scenario paths, within which the

Board has discretion to choose values based on current conditions and other relevant consider-

ations. For this year’s scenario, the Board proposes to calibrate the values of scenario characteris-

tics for which the guides provide flexibility, such as the peak values of the BBB spread and VIX,

near or in the upper one-third of their ranges of severity. The Board chose this calibration to gen-

erate an appropriate level of overall severity given the paths of the unemployment rate and house

prices, and given the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions described above. This

calibration is consistent with the Board’s goal of improving predictability and transparency of the

annual scenarios. The calibration also reflects both the Board’s principle of conservatism and its

goal that the annual stress tests should not add to other sources of procyclicality in the finan-

cial system.

Details of the Severely Adverse Scenario

The proposed 2026 severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession trig-

gered by an abrupt decline in risk appetite that causes substantial declines in risky asset prices

and declines in risk-free interest rates. At times during the first months of this scenario, financial

market functioning is impaired, leading to substantial additional volatility. Those disruptions spill

over into large reductions in household demand for goods and services and significantly reduce

employment and business investment. The low levels of risk appetite and the declines in income

and wealth persist for some time and lead to a protracted recession in the United States and

abroad. This is a hypothetical scenario designed to assess the strength and resilience of banks

and does not represent a forecast of the Federal Reserve.

Consistent with both the 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement and the Proposed 2025 Sce-

nario Design Policy Statement, under the proposed 2026 severely adverse scenario, the U.S.

unemployment rate climbs to a peak of 10 percent in the third quarter of 2027 (see table 3.A), a

5.5 percentage point increase relative to its fourth-quarter 2025 level. The unemployment rate

reaches its peak in the seventh quarter of the scenario, which is the midpoint of the range of six

to eight quarters generally established by the guide for the unemployment rate to reach its peak.

The Board chose this middle value for the timing of the peak of the unemployment rate to balance

8

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

the marginal effect of a slightly more-severe or less-severe path for the unemployment rate on

overall scenario severity.

House prices fall steadily through the fourth quarter of 2027, reaching a trough that is about

29 percent below their level in the fourth quarter of 2025. The level of this trough is determined

by the relevant component of the guide for the house prices in the Proposed 2025 Scenario

Design Policy Statement, which is the same as the guide in the Board’s 2019 Scenario Design

Policy Statement. The eighth-quarter trough timing is at the lower end of the range of 8 to 10 quar-

ters prescribed by the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement’s guide for house prices,

in line with the Board’s proposal to calibrate most of the scenario variables for which the Board

retains some discretion near the upper one-third of their ranges of severity. 

The spread between mortgage rates and 10-year Treasury yields widens 1.3 percentage points to

reach a level of 3.4 percentage points by the third quarter of 2026 before narrowing to a level of

about 2.4 percentage points at the end of the severely adverse scenario. The jump-off-to-peak

increase of 1.3 percentage points is at the upper one-third of the range of 0.7 to 1.6 percentage

points specified by the proposed guide for the mortgage spread. The mortgage spread reaches its

peak in the third quarter of the scenario, which is the early end of the range of three to four quar-

ters allowed by the guide for the spread to reach its peak. In determining the trajectory of the

mortgage spread from its jump-off point to its trough, the guide for the mortgage spread in the

Board’s Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement specifies a range for the proportion of

declines in each quarter along the trajectory to the trough. In the proposed severely adverse sce-

nario, 62 percent of the jump-off-to-peak increase in the mortgage spread occurs in the first

quarter of the scenario, which is near the upper one-third of the range of 50 to 70 percent pre-

scribed by the proposed guide, in line with the Board’s proposal to calibrate most of the scenario

variables for which the Board retains some discretion near the upper one-third of their ranges of

severity.

Equity prices fall about 54 percent from the fourth quarter of 2025 through the third quarter of

2026. The jump-off-to-trough decline of about 54 percent is prescribed by the guide for equity

prices in the Board’s Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement, and reflects that equity

prices, as proxied by the U.S. Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index, rise 7 percent in 2025 in the

baseline scenario. The guide for equity prices in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy State-

ment reflects the principle that equity prices in the scenario fall more after periods when they have

risen more. In the proposed scenario, 67 percent of the decline in equity prices occurs in the first

quarter of the scenario while 17 percent occurs in the second quarter. These values are at the

upper one-third of the respective ranges specified by the guide, in line with the Board’s proposal to

calibrate most of the scenario variables for which the Board retains some discretion near the

upper one-third of their ranges of severity.

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

The VIX, measured as the highest daily closing value per quarter, reaches a peak of 72 percent in

the second quarter of 2026. Seventy-three percent of the increase in the VIX occurs in the first

quarter of the scenario. This value, and the peak value of the VIX of 72 percent, are in the top

one-third of their respective ranges in the proposed guide for the VIX.

Conditions in corporate bond markets deteriorate markedly, as the scenario specifies a sudden

decline in risk appetite and worsening business conditions. The spread between yields on BBB-

rated bonds and yields on 10-year Treasury securities increases 4.4 percentage points by the third

quarter of 2026, reaching a level of 5.7 percentage points. Seventy percent of the jump-off-to-

peak increase in the BBB spread occurs in the first quarter of the scenario. The peak level of

5.7 percentage points and the pace of the increase in the BBB spread are both near the upper

one-third of their respective ranges prescribed by the guide for the BBB spread in the Board’s Pro-

posed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement.

Commercial real estate prices reach a trough in the fourth quarter of 2027 that is 40 percent

below their level at the end of 2025. The jump-off-to-trough decline in commercial real estate

prices is at the top one-third of the range of 30 to 45 percent prescribed by the guide for commer-

cial real estate prices in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement. Commercial real

estate prices reach their trough in the eighth quarter of the scenario, which is the bottom of the

range of eight to ten quarters prescribed by the guide for commercial real estate prices to reach

its trough, in line with the Board’s proposal to calibrate most of the scenario variables for which

the Board retains some discretion near the upper one-third of their ranges of severity.

The proposed scenario paths for real GDP, inflation, and the 3-month Treasury rate are generated

by the macro model for Stress Testing discussed in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy
Statement, when given the path for the unemployment rate.16 Real GDP declines 4.8 percent from

the fourth quarter of 2025 to its trough in the second quarter of 2027, before recovering to the

level at the jump-off. This path for real GDP is based on the path for the unemployment rate given
the version of Okun’s law in the macroeconomic model.17 Real disposable income, which depends

in part on real GDP, declines about 1 percent in the proposed scenario from the fourth quarter of

2025 to its trough in the fourth quarter of 2026, before recovering and gradually surpassing its

level at the jump-off. The Phillips curve component of the model projects a significant reduction in

inflation given the rising unemployment rate and the rapid decline in aggregate demand for goods

and services. Inflation, measured as the quarterly change in the CPI and reported as an annual-

ized rate, falls from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 1.1 percent in the second quarter

16 See Enhanced Transparency and Public Accountability Proposed Rule.
17 Okun’s law is a well-established economic relationship linking fluctuations in the unemployment rate to fluctuations in
real GDP. See Arthur M. Okun, “Potential GNP: Its Measurement and Significance,” in Proceedings of the Business and
Economics Section, 98–103. See also Jonathan McCarthy, Simon M. Potter, and Ging Cee Ng. “Okun’s Law and Long
Expansions, March 27, 2012, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/03/okuns-law-and-long-expansions/.

10

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

of 2027 and then gradually increases only to 1.3 percent by the end of the scenario. The paths of

inflation and a measure of the output gap, which depends on the unemployment rate, are inputs

to the Taylor rule used in the macroeconomic model, which in turn determines the 3-month

Treasury rate. The 3-month Treasury rate falls significantly from 4 percent in the fourth quarter of

2025 to 0.1 percent by the second quarter of 2026 and remains there for the remainder of the
scenario.18

The paths for long-term interest rates, as measured by the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields, are

determined by two components. The initial paths to the trough are determined by the proposed

guides. The paths from the trough to the end of the scenario are determined by the macro model

for Stress Testing. These paths are therefore informed by the scenario paths of short-term interest

rates and estimates of likely term premiums in an economic environment consistent with the nar-

rative for the severely adverse scenario. Overall, the jump-off-to-trough declines in the 5-year and

10-year Treasury yields are consistent with key features of the scenario, including severe declines

in aggregate demand for goods and services and in risk appetite at the start of the scenario. In

general, a decline in long-term interest rates may have a positive or negative effect on the severity

of the scenario for a given firm depending on the firm’s exposure to interest rate risk—which may

vary from year to year depending on the firm’s portfolio—due to the opposing effects that changes

in interest rates have on net interest margins and on the market-adjusted valuations of long-term,

fixed-rate securities.

In proposing the paths for long-term interest rates, the Board took into consideration the current

level of long-term interest rates and their changes in recent recessions. In the proposed scenario,

the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields fall 2.5 percentage points and 2 percentage points to

1.3 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, by the fourth quarter of 2026. These declines are

roughly in line with the declines of 2.6 percentage points and 1.6 percentage points, respectively,

experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009 during the 2007–

2009 financial crisis. That recession was comparable in magnitude and length to the hypothetical

recession in the scenario, and significantly deeper and longer lasting than the early 2000s reces-

sion or the 2020 pandemic recession, during which rates declined by less. Both the 5-year and

the 10-year yields reach their troughs in the fourth quarter of the proposed scenario. Consistent

with their guides, the declines in the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields are frontloaded, with about

55 percent of the declines occurring in the first quarter of the scenario, in line with the severe

contraction in economic activity and heightened uncertainty featured in the scenario. The sizable

declines in the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields, the speed of those declines, and the timing of

their troughs are appropriate given the modeled decline of the 3-month Treasury bill yield and its

Indicators.

11

persistence at a near-zero level in this scenario.19 In addition, the timing of the troughs of the

long-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the proposed scenario reflects the Board’s willing-

ness to balance the effects that changes in interest rates have on net interest margins and on the

market-adjusted values of long-term, fixed-rate securities.

The international component of the proposed severely adverse scenario involves a sharp deteriora-

tion in foreign economic activity, in line with the experience of the 2007–2009 financial crisis (see

table 3.B). In the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan, real GDP declines about 7.5 percent

relative to its value in the baseline scenario by the end of 2026, which is consistent with the

deviation observed in the level of real GDP in the first quarter of 2009 from a baseline path

derived from the April 2008 IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast as described in the inter-

national guides. As a result, these advanced economies experience recessions with real GDP

declining from jump-off to trough by 5.9 percent in the euro area, 6.1 percent in the United

Kingdom, and 6.2 percent in Japan. In developing Asia, real GDP growth slows down and runs

about 3 percent below baseline by the end of 2026. Over the same period, inflation declines

about 3 percentage points below baseline in the advanced economies, and 5 percentage points

below baseline in developing Asia. The U.S. dollar appreciates about 15 percent against the euro

and the British pound, while it depreciates mildly against the Japanese yen by 1 percent, consis-

tent with its historical behavior between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.

Consistent with the guides for the international variables in the Board’s Proposed 2025 Scenario

Design Policy Statement, the deviation of each international scenario variable from its baseline

path is similar to that observed during the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

Question 3: The Board invites comment on all aspects of the proposed severely adverse scenario.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scenario? Are there risks or conditions

that the Board should consider incorporating into the scenario that are not described in this

scenario?

Question 4: Is the Board’s proposal to calibrate similarly the severity of several of those scenario

variables for which the Board retains some discretion in setting their values appropriate? Is the

Board’s proposed calibration of those variables appropriate in terms of severity? Should the Board

adjust any of the variable paths? If so, what information should the Board consider in assessing

these variable paths?

In prior years, the scenario disclosure document featured a section called “Additional Key Features

of the Severely Adverse Scenario,” which briefly described assumptions regarding the distribution

of stress not fully captured by the BBB spread, indexes of U.S. real estate prices, and the four

country blocs in the international scenario. For more information on the distribution of stress not

fully captured by the BBB spread, indexes of U.S. real estate prices, and the four country blocs in

the international scenario, please refer to the detailed documentation released separately. Specifi-

cally, see section III.B of the October 2025 notice.

Comparison of the 2026 Severely Adverse Scenario to the 2025 Severely
Adverse Scenario

In general, changes in the paths of scenario variables from year to year reflect a combination of

changes arising from different jump-off levels and, for those variables where the Board retains

some discretion, choices by the Board about the appropriate level of scenario severity. In the pro-

posed severely adverse scenario, the unemployment rate in the United States rises to the same

level as in the 2025 severely adverse scenario. The increase in the unemployment rate currently

is smaller in this year’s scenario, reflecting the higher jump-off level implied by the August 2025

Blue Chip Economic Indicators. This is consistent with the guide for the unemployment rate in both

the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement and the 2019 Scenario Design Policy State-

ment, which both call for an increase in the unemployment rate to at least a level of 10 percent

given current conditions.

In this year’s scenario, the paths for real GDP, real disposable income, inflation, and the 3-month

Treasury rate are generated by the macro model for stress testing, given the path for the unem-

ployment rate and other modeled factors. Real GDP declines by less and reaches its trough one

quarter later compared to last year’s scenario. The decline in inflation is larger compared to last

year’s scenario. These differences reflect both the new model and this year’s jump-off conditions.

The path for real disposable income also features a lower decline compared to last year, as it

depends on the path for real GDP.

The 3-month Treasury rate reaches the same trough level as in last year’s scenario but declines

somewhat less, owing to its slightly lower jump-off level in this year’s proposed scenario. As

described above, the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields decline somewhat less in response to the

hypothetical drop in economic activity and inflation and reach their troughs somewhat later than in

last year’s scenario. The proposed severely adverse scenario also features a somewhat smaller

decline in house prices as compared to the previous year’s severely adverse scenario, consistent

with the guide for house prices in both the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement and

the 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement, both of which call for a smaller decline in house

prices when the ratio of nominal house prices to per capita disposable income is lower. Mortgage

spreads reach higher levels than in last year’s scenario. Commercial real estate prices decline

more than in last year’s scenario, but the decline is similar to past scenarios.

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

13

The decline in equity prices is somewhat more severe than in last year’s scenario, reflecting the

effect of the moderate increase in equity prices since last year in the proposed guide for equity

prices. In this year’s scenario, the VIX and the BBB spread both reach levels that are higher than

in last year’s scenario but similar to those in prior years. The international component of the pro-

posed severely adverse scenario is consistent with the design of international scenarios described

in both the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement and the Board’s 2019 Scenario

Design Policy Statement. The proposed scenario shows a recessionary episode that, relative to

last year’s severely adverse scenario, is somewhat less severe for Japan and developing Asia and

is somewhat more severe for the euro area and the United Kingdom. This scenario is consistent

with the level of stress in foreign economies that manifested during the 2007–2009 finan-

cial crisis.

Methodology to Update the Scenarios to Incorporate Additional Data Releases

After disclosing a proposed severely adverse scenario for public comment, the Board expects to

make two types of revisions to the scenario. First, the Board may make revisions to the scenario

to address comments received from the public. Second, the Board will make revisions to incorpo-

rate additional data releases that occur after the publication of this proposal and affect the his-

torical values of specific scenario variables. This section of notice addresses the second: data-

based revisions to the severely adverse scenario.

Generally, the historical dataset that accompanies the proposed severely adverse scenario will be

based on data released through August 29. For the proposed 2026 scenarios, the final dataset

will incorporate data released through mid-January, as well as updated external forecasts. In par-

ticular, the final dataset will reflect new data for the jump-off quarter of the scenarios. As the sce-

nario paths for all variables are dependent on the conditions during the jump-off quarter, the

severely adverse scenario will be revised to reflect the updated jump-off conditions.

The process for updating the scenario paths given an updated historical dataset will comprise two

steps. First, variables that are determined by formula-based guides will be updated by referencing

the scenario guides in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement to the new jump-off
points in the historical dataset.20 Variables that are informed by guides that allow for some discre-

tion by the Board are likely to be adjusted to match the same level of the peak or trough in the

released scenario, unless doing so violated some other aspect of that particular guide. These

updates likely will require a change in the trajectory from the new jump-off points that will follow

20 Guide-based variables refer to stress test scenario variables for which the Board has published scenario guides, as

reflected in the Board’s 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement and the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy State-
ment. These guides include the unemployment rate and house prices, and are proposed to include the yield on BBB cor-
porate bonds, the rate on 30-year conforming mortgages, commercial real estate prices, equity prices, VIX, the yield on
5-year Treasuries, and the yield on 10-year Treasuries. The guide-based variables also include all of the international
scenario variables, which include GDP, inflation, and exchange rates for the four countries or country blocs: the United
Kingdom, Japan, developing Asia, and the euro area. As noted, the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement
remains consistent with the 2019 Scenario Design Policy Statement.

14

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

the process described in that portion of the guides. Next, the updated historical dataset and sce-

nario paths for guide-based variables will be used as inputs to rerun the scenario model to update
the scenario paths for all model-determined variables.21

Question 6: The Board invites comment on how it plans to update the scenarios to incorporate addi-

tional data releases.

Guide-based variables

The scenario guides described in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement allow, in

some cases, for judgment within a range. As such, updating the paths for the guide-based vari-

ables will follow the general principle that revisions to the severely adverse scenario that arise

because of changes in macroeconomic and financial conditions should avoid making the scenario

more severe, should financial and macroeconomic conditions worsen. Conversely, the revisions

should also avoid making the scenario less severe should financial and macroeconomic conditions

improve. An additional consideration is that the overall scenario severity is a function of both

levels and changes in the scenario variables.

In line with this principle, the Board expects that its standard approach to revising the scenario in

response to new data is likely to keep constant the level reached by each variable at its peak or

trough in the scenario released for comment for the guide-based variables, so long as this level

implies a change relative to the jump-off value that is aligned with that variable’s scenario guide.

The Board expects to deviate from this default updating method for the peak or trough value of

guide-based variables in cases where, for example, maintaining the peak or trough level achieved

in the scenario would result in a violation of any element of the scenario guide for a variable. This

could be the case when data released between the disclosure of the proposed and final scenario

indicate significant changes in the jump-off conditions. In such instances, the Board expects to

adjust to target an appropriate level of change, as described in the Proposed 2025 Scenario

Design Policy Statement with respect to that variable’s scenario guide and informed by the Board’s
supervisory experience and expertise.22

Under either approach, the revisions are expected to keep constant the quarters in which the peak

or trough values are attained, barring substantial changes in the economic or financial environment.

21 Model-determined variables refer to the domestic variables for which the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy State-
ment proposes employing the macro model for Stress Testing to determine their scenario paths. These include real and
nominal GDP, real and nominal disposable personal income, CPI inflation, the rate on 3-month Treasuries, and the prime
lending rate.

22 For example, consider a proposed scenario released for public comment where the VIX increases from a jump-off value
of 30 percent to a peak level of 65 percent. If, when incorporating new data, the jump-off value becomes 60 percent,
then maintaining a peak level of 65 percent implies an increase of only 5 percentage points, which is less than the
minimum allowed change of 10 percentage points defined in this variable’s scenario guide.

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

15

For each variable, the revisions will be phased in by adjusting the scenario path through the peak

or trough, thus altering the changes relative to the jump-off point.

Furthermore, the values of variables at the end of the scenario and the trajectory from the trough

to the end point will update to reflect the new jump-off data. The Board expects this process will

occur as outlined in the scenario guide in the Proposed 2025 Scenario Design Policy Statement.

Question 7: The Board invites comment on how it plans to update the scenarios with respect to

guide-based variables.

Model-based variables

To update the scenario paths for model-based variables, the Board expects to recompute their full

scenario paths using the macro model for Stress Testing outlined in the policy statement taking as

inputs the updated historical dataset and the updated scenario paths for the guide-based vari-

ables. This approach may result in revisions to the scenario paths for these variables relative to

the proposed scenario disclosed for public comment but should maintain the appropriate level of

scenario severity and ensure overall consistency across all the variables in the stress test

scenario.

Question 8: The Board invites comment on how it plans to update the scenarios with respect to

model-based variables.

Global Market Shock Component for the Supervisory Severely
Adverse Scenario

The global market shock component for the severely adverse scenario (global market shock) is a

set of hypothetical shocks to a large set of risk factors reflecting general market distress and

heightened uncertainty. Banks with significant trading activity must consider the global market
shock as part of the supervisory severely adverse scenario in their company-run stress test.23 The

losses associated with the global market shock are recognized in the first quarter of the scenario

and are carried through all subsequent quarters. In addition, certain large and highly inter-

connected firms must apply the same global market shock to project losses under the counter-

party default scenario component. The global market shock is applied to positions held by the

23 The global market shock applies to a firm that is subject to the stress test; that has aggregate trading assets and liabili-
ties of $50 billion or more, or aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10 percent or more of total consolidated
assets; and that is not a Category IV firm under the Board’s tailoring framework. See 12 CFR § 238.143(b)(2)(i);
12 CFR § 252.54(b)(2)(i).

16

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

banks on a given as-of date, which must fall between October 1 and March 1.24 These shocks do

not represent a forecast of the Federal Reserve.

The design and specification of the global market shock differ from the macroeconomic scenarios

in several ways. First, profits and losses from trading and counterparty credit are measured in

mark-to-market terms, while revenues and losses from traditional banking are generally measured

using the accrual method. Another key difference is the timing of loss recognition. The global

market shock affects the mark-to-market value of trading positions and counterparty credit losses

in the first quarter of the severely adverse scenario. This timing is based on an observation that

market dislocations can happen rapidly and unpredictably at any time under stressed conditions.

Applying the global market shock in the first quarter ensures that potential losses from trading

and counterparty exposures are incorporated into banks’ capital ratios in each quarter of the

severely adverse scenario.

The global market shock is specified by a large set of risk factors that include, but are not

limited to

• public equity returns from key advanced economies and from developing and emerging market

economies, along with selected points along term structures of equity option-implied volatilities;

• exchange rates of foreign currencies, along with selected points along term structures of foreign

exchange option-implied volatilities;

• government yields at selected maturities (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasuries), swap rates, and other

types of interest rates for key advanced economies and from developing and emerging market

economies;

• implied volatilities on interest rate options for selected maturities and expiration dates, which

are key inputs to the pricing of interest rate derivatives;

• futures prices at various expiration dates for commodity products such as energy, oil, metals,

and agricultural products; and

• credit spreads or prices for selected credit-sensitive products, including corporate bonds, credit

default swaps (CDS), securitized products, sovereign debt, and municipal bonds.

The Board considers emerging and ongoing areas of financial market vulnerabilities in the develop-

ment of the global market shock. This assessment of potential vulnerabilities is informed by finan-

cial stability reports, supervisory information, and internal and external assessments of potential

sources of distress such as geopolitical, economic, and financial market events.

24 The as-of date for the global market shock is subject to change. The Board invites comment on this as-of date change

through its website, at https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/proposals/FR-2025-0063-01/details.

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

17

The global market shock includes a set of risk factor shocks to financial market variables that

apply to all banks with significant trading activity. Depending on the type of financial market vulner-

ability that the global market shock is intended to assess, the risk factor shocks could be based

on a single historical episode, multiple historical periods, hypothetical events that are based on

relevant economic indicators of economic and financial conditions, or a hybrid approach com-

prising some combination of historical episodes and hypothetical events. A market shock based

on hypothetical events may result in changes in risk factors that have not been observed
historically.25

Risk factor shocks are calibrated using assumed time horizons. The calibration horizons reflect

several considerations related to the scenario being modeled. One important consideration is the

liquidity characteristics of different risk factors. These characteristics may vary depending on the

specified market shock narrative. More specifically, the calibration horizons reflect the variation in

the speed at which banks could reasonably close out, or effectively hedge, risk exposures in the

event of market stress. The calibration horizons are generally longer than the typical times needed

to liquidate exposures under normal conditions because they are designed to capture the unpre-
dictable liquidity conditions that prevail in times of stress.26 In addition, shocks to risk factors in

more liquid markets, such as those for government securities, foreign exchange, or public equi-

ties, are calibrated to shorter horizons (1 month), while shocks to risk factors in less liquid

markets, such as those for non-agency securitized products, have longer calibration horizons

(3 months).

2026 Global Market Shock Component of the Supervisory Severely Adverse
Scenario

The 2026 global market shock is characterized by heightened market expectations of persistently

high inflation, higher commodity prices, and a global recession. The scenario has certain elements

in common with prior episodes of market reactions to periods of expected high inflation combined

with low growth, such as the oil crisis of the 1970s. That period was also characterized by com-

modity price increases.

Both short-term and long-term Treasury rates rise sharply driven by higher inflation expectations.

Heightened inflation expectations drive commodity prices upward.

25 For example, credit spread changes in the municipal credit markets during March and April of 2020 would have been

considered unprecedented had they been used in earlier global market shocks.

26 The liquidity of previously well-functioning financial markets can undergo abrupt changes in times of financial stress. For
example, prior to the Global Financial Crisis, AAA-rated private-label RMBS would likely have been considered highly
liquid, but their liquidity deteriorated drastically during the crisis period.

18

Proposed 2026 Stress Test Scenarios

The expected fall in economic activity leads to notable equity price declines across global mar-

kets. Concerns about corporate credit defaults in light of the economic slowdown leads to wider

credit spreads.

The U.S. dollar strengthens, exhibiting large gains against the euro and moderate gains against

the Japanese yen driven by higher yields in the U.S.

Comparison of the 2026 Global Market Shock Component and the 2025 Global
Market Shock Component

The 2026 global market shock features expectations for higher inflation, while last year’s global

market shock was characterized by expectations for lower inflation. Accordingly, the main differ-

ence between the 2025 and 2026 global market shocks is the behavior of interest rates, foreign

exchange rates, and commodities prices. Treasury yields increase across all tenors in the current

global market shock, whereas last year, yields decreased with short-term yields falling more than

long-term yields. Inflation breakeven rates increase in the current global market shock, while they

decreased in the 2025 global market shock.

The U.S. dollar appreciates against most major currencies in both the 2025 and 2026 global

market shocks. However, an exception is that the dollar appreciates against the Japanese yen in

the 2026 global market shocks, while it depreciated against the yen in the 2025 global market

shock. In both years, the U.S. dollar appreciates with respect to emerging market currencies.

Commodities—such as gold, oil, and natural gas—exhibit price increases due to inflationary pres-

sures in the current global market shock, while commodity prices decreased in the 2025 global

market shock. Credit spreads widen and equity prices fall in both the 2025 and 2026 global

market shocks.

Counterparty Default Component of the Supervisory Severely
Adverse Scenario

Large firms with substantial trading or custodial operations are required to incorporate a counter-

party default scenario component into their supervisory severely adverse scenario for 2025 and
recognize associated losses in the first quarter of the scenario.27 This component involves the

unexpected default of the firm’s largest counterparty. In identifying its largest counterparty, a firm

27 The Board may require a company to include one or more additional components in its severely adverse scenario in the
annual stress test based on the company’s financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or
activities, or based on risks to the U.S. economy. See 12 CFR § 238.143(b)(2)(ii); 12 CFR § 252.54(b)(2)(ii).

Supervisory Stress Test Scenarios

subject to the counterparty default component will not consider certain entities.28 In addition to

sovereign entities and qualified central counterparties, certain multilateral development banks and

supranational entities (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International

Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, European Commission, and European Central

Bank) will not be considered for the counterparty default component to better align the treatment

of these entities across regulatory exercises. The Board is separately proposing to exclude certain
additional sovereign entities from the counterparty default component.29

The counterparty default scenario component is an add-on to the Federal Reserve’s severely

adverse scenario: firms are required to estimate and report the potential losses and related

effects on capital associated with the unexpected default of the counterparty that would generate

the largest net stressed losses across their derivatives and securities financing transactions.

Net stressed losses are estimated by applying the global market shock to revalue securities

financing transactions and derivatives, including collateral posted or received. The as-of date for

the counterparty default scenario component for the is the same as-of date as for the global
market shock component.30

Question 9: The Board invites comment on how the separate proposal to exclude certain additional

sovereign entities from the counterparty default component should be incorporated into the 2026

global market shock.

28 In identifying its largest counterparty, a firm subject to the counterparty default component will not consider certain sov-
ereign entities (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), certain multilateral
development banks and supranational entities (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International
Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, European Commission, and European Central Bank), or qualifying
central counterparties (QCCPs). See the definition of a QCCP at 12 CFR § 217.2.
Please note that although the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is excluded, the other subsid-
iaries of World Bank Group (including the International Development Association, International Finance Corporation, Mul-
tilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) must be consid-
ered when selecting the firm’s largest counterparty.
U.S. IHCs are not required to include any affiliate as a counterparty. An affiliate of a company includes a parent of the
company, as well as any other firm that is consolidated with the company under applicable accounting standards,
including U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards. See
12 CFR § 252.171(b) & (f).

29 See description of the Largest Counterparty Default Model, available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/

dfa-stress-tests-2026.htm. See also Enhanced Transparency and Public Accountability Proposed Rule.

30 As with the global market shock component, a firm subject to the counterparty default component may use data as of
the date that corresponds to its weekly internal risk reporting cycle so long as it falls during the business week of the
as-of date for the counterparty default scenario component.

Minutes of the Federal Open Market 
Committee 
September 16--17, 2025 

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, September 16, 2025, 

at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, September 17, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations 

The deputy manager turned first to an overview of financial market developments during the 

intermeeting period.  Markets appeared to interpret data releases and FOMC communications as 

indicating that the baseline outlook was little changed but that downside risks to the labor market had 

increased.  Median modal expectations for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation this 

year and next from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey) increased 

only slightly, and expectations for the unemployment rate increased only marginally overall.  However, 

after the weaker-than-expected July and August employment reports, investors’ focus shifted to 

downside risks to the labor market.   

Near-term expectations for the policy rate had moved lower in response to weaker-than-expected 

employment data and the apparent rise in downside employment risks.  Almost all respondents to the 

Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this 

meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting.  The vast majority of 

survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting 

three cuts over that time.  Respondents’ expectations for 2027 and beyond were unchanged, implying 

that revisions to respondents’ near-term expectations reflected an anticipation of a faster return of the 

federal funds rate to its longer-run level than previously expected.  Market-based measures of policy 

rate expectations were broadly consistent with responses to the Desk survey, reflecting about three 

25 basis point cuts by the end of the year.   

The deputy manager then discussed developments in Treasury markets and market-based measures 

of inflation compensation.  Nominal Treasury yields fell 20 to 40 basis points over the intermeeting

Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes.

period, with the largest decline occurring at the short end of the yield curve; the curve therefore 

steepened.  Staff models indicated that nearly all the decline in short-term rates was attributable to 

the shift down in policy rate expectations.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation fell 

slightly over the intermeeting period. 

Equity prices continued to rise over the intermeeting period and stood very close to record highs 

despite the recent weaker-than-expected employment reports.  The deputy manager noted this 

development was consistent with the benign baseline macroeconomic outlook incorporated in most 

private-sector forecasts and strong realized earnings in technology and other sectors.  Corporate bond 

spreads were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained at tight levels, signaling that 

investors anticipated relatively moderate credit losses. 

Regarding foreign exchange developments, the deputy manager noted that the broad trade-weighted 

dollar index had generally stabilized and that the dollar returned to trading roughly in line with 

fundamental macroeconomic drivers over the intermeeting period.  The available data continued to 

suggest foreign demand for U.S. assets remained resilient. 

The deputy manager turned next to money markets.  The effective federal funds rate remained stable, 

and repurchase agreement (repo) rates moved higher over the intermeeting period.  The increase in 

repo rates over the period was driven by the increase in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding 

of the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the debt ceiling resolution, continued large Treasury 

coupon issuance, and ongoing reductions in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Reserves fell 

sharply on September 15 in response to an increase in the TGA, driven by tax receipts and significant 

net issuance of Treasury coupon securities.  Repo rates came under additional upward pressure that 

day, and take-up at the standing repo facility (SRF) reached $1.5 billion.  There were some signs of 

slight upward pressure on rates in the federal funds market but not enough to move the effective 

federal funds rate.  While key indicators remained consistent with abundant reserves, money market 

rates were expected to continue to increase over time relative to administered rates and to eventually 

pull the effective federal funds rate higher. 

The deputy manager concluded by discussing the trajectory of the balance sheet.  If balance sheet 

runoff were to continue at the current pace, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio was 

expected to decline to just over $6 trillion by the end of March, with Federal Reserve notes growing at 

a gradual pace, the TGA fluctuating around current levels, and usage of the overnight reverse 

repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remaining very low except on quarter-end dates.  As a result, 

the deputy manager expected reserves to be close to the $2.8 trillion range by the end of the first 

quarter of next year if runoff were to continue at the current pace. 

 
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    3 

All but one member of the Committee voted to ratify the Desk’s domestic transactions over the 

intermeeting period.  Governor Stephen Miran, who had been sworn in as a member of the Board that 

morning, abstained from voting.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the 

System’s account during the intermeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) 

growth had moderated in the first half of the year.  Although the unemployment rate continued to be 

low, the pace of employment increases had slowed, and labor market conditions had softened.  

Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. 

Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index—was 

estimated to have been 2.7 percent in August, based on the data from the consumer and producer 

price indexes.  Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many 

consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.9 percent in August.  Both inflation rates were at 

the upper end of their ranges since the beginning of the year. 

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had softened.  The unemployment rate edged up 

to 4.3 percent in August, a little higher than it had been at the beginning of the year.  The participation 

rate was somewhat lower in August than it was at the beginning of the year.  Average monthly 

increases in total nonfarm payrolls over July and August were weak, and job gains were revised down 

notably in May and June.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) preliminary estimate of the benchmark 

revision for April 2024 through March 2025 indicated that the level of payrolls for March was more 

than 900,000 lower than had been reported.  The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 

1.0 in August and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year.  The employment cost 

index of hourly compensation for private-sector workers increased 3.5 percent over the 12 months 

ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the 12 months 

ending in August.  Both wage growth measures were lower than their year-earlier levels. 

Real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter, but GDP growth over the first 

half as a whole was slower than last year.  Growth of real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—

which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP 

of underlying economic momentum—had also moderated in the first half relative to last year.  Recent 

indicators for consumer spending and business investment spending—particularly for high-tech 

equipment and software—pointed to further moderate gains in PDFP in the third quarter, but housing-

sector activity remained weak.  After falling sharply in the second quarter, real imports of goods 

increased in July, particularly for capital goods.  By contrast, exports edged down in July, following 

modest increases over the first half of the year. 

 
4    September 16-17, 2025 

Foreign GDP growth slowed markedly in the second quarter, as the transitory boost due to the front-

loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded.  Canadian economic activity contracted significantly, 

as exports of price-sensitive industrial supplies fell sharply in the face of higher U.S. tariffs.  Economic 

growth in Mexico and parts of Asia was supported by strong demand for high-tech products.  

Headline inflation was near central banks’ targets in most foreign economies, aided by past declines 

in energy prices.  However, core inflation remained persistently elevated in some economies, such as 

Brazil, Mexico, and the U.K.  By contrast, inflation in China continued to be subdued.  Several foreign 

central banks—including the European Central Bank—held their policy rates steady, while others—such 

as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of Australia—resumed reducing their 

policy rates, as disinflation continued. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

The market-implied path of the federal funds rate decreased notably over the intermeeting period.  

Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing a higher probability 

on greater policy easing by early 2026 than they had just before the July FOMC meeting.  Consistent 

with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path, nominal Treasury yields declined notably, on 

net, particularly at shorter horizons.  Changes in nominal yields were driven primarily by reductions in 

real Treasury yields as inflation compensation fell to a lesser degree, on net, across maturities.  

Broad equity price indexes increased amid strong corporate earnings reports and expectations of 

lower policy rates, while credit spreads were little changed and remained very low by historical 

standards.  The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—ended the period 

essentially unchanged, on net, at a moderate level. 

Risk sentiment generally improved in global financial markets, supported by trade policy 

developments that were perceived as reducing negative tail risks to economic growth, strong 

corporate earnings, and lower interest rates in the U.S.  On balance, foreign equity indexes rose 

moderately, credit spreads narrowed slightly, and the exchange value of the dollar declined modestly.  

Increased political uncertainty led to volatility of longer-term government bond yields in some 

advanced foreign economies. 

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period, and the 

FOMC’s target policy rate continued to transmit to private rates in the usual manner.  Following the 

increase in the federal debt limit in early July, TGA balances continued to increase, while usage of the 

ON RRP facility declined notably to its lowest levels since April 2021.  Amid increases in the TGA, there 

were mild upward pressures in secured market rates over the July and August month-ends.  Secured 

rates remained elevated in the lead-up to the mid-September tax and coupon issuance date.  On 

 
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    5 

September 15, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate temporarily printed above the minimum bid rate 

at the SRF amid $1.5 billion in take-up at the facility.  Amid these movements in secured rates, the 

effective federal funds rate remained unchanged relative to the interest rate on reserve balances.  

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs generally declined but remained elevated relative to their 

average post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) levels.  Yields on corporate bonds decreased moderately, 

while yields on leveraged loans were little changed on net.  Interest rates on commercial and industrial 

(C&I) and short-term business loans remained elevated relative to their post-GFC averages.  Rates on 

30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined moderately, on net, and remained 

elevated.  Yields on higher-rated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) moved 

down modestly, and those on lower-rated tranches of non-agency CMBS declined notably.  Interest 

rates on existing credit card accounts continued to tick up through June, while offer rates on new 

credit cards were little changed.  

Financing from capital markets remained broadly available for medium-sized and large businesses.  

Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds across credit categories continued at a strong pace in 

July and August, and issuance of leveraged loans was robust in recent months.  Lending in private 

credit markets continued at a solid pace in July.  After relatively strong growth in the second quarter, 

C&I loan balances on banks’ books also continued to grow at a solid pace in July and August.  

Commercial real estate (CRE) loans continued to grow at a modest pace in July and August. 

Credit remained available for most businesses, households, and municipalities, while credit continued 

to be relatively tight for small businesses and households with lower credit scores.  In the residential 

mortgage market, credit remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard 

conforming loan criteria but generally tight for low-credit-score borrowers.  While consumer credit 

remained generally available for most households, the growth of revolving credit and auto loans was 

relatively weak in the second quarter.  

Credit quality was generally stable at levels somewhat weaker than during the pre-pandemic period.  

The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained generally stable, though the 

default rate for leveraged loans that includes distressed exchanges continued to be elevated.  

Delinquency rates on small business loans in June and July ticked up and were moderately above pre-

pandemic levels.  In the CRE market, CMBS delinquency rates remained elevated through August.  

Regarding household credit quality, the delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration 

mortgages remained at the upper end of their range over the past few years.  By contrast, delinquency 

rates on most other mortgage loan types stayed near historical lows.  In the second quarter, credit 

card and auto loan delinquency rates remained at elevated levels but were little changed.

Staff Economic Outlook 

Compared with the staff forecast prepared for the July meeting, the projection of real GDP growth was 

revised up somewhat, on balance, for this year through 2028, primarily reflecting stronger-than-

expected data for both consumer spending and business investment as well as financial conditions 

that were projected to be a little more supportive of output growth.  GDP growth was still projected to 

be faster next year than this year, as the effects of tariff increases and slower net immigration were 

expected to diminish.  The staff continued to expect that the labor market would soften further this 

year, though the projected path for the unemployment rate in following years was a little lower than in 

the previous staff forecast.  The unemployment rate was projected to move slightly above the staff’s 

estimate of its natural rate through the remainder of this year and then to decline later in the 

projection as GDP growth picked up. 

The staff’s inflation projection was only slightly revised from the one prepared for the July meeting.  

Tariff increases were still expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward 

pressure on inflation in 2026.  Inflation was projected to decline in 2026, to reach 2 percent in 2027, 

and to remain there in 2028. 

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting 

uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including those for trade, immigration, fiscal 

spending, and regulation, and their associated economic effects.  Risks to employment and the labor 

market were judged to have become a little more tilted to the downside, stemming from the recent 

softening in labor market conditions amid modest real GDP growth.  The staff continued to view the 

risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year 

could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection.  

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely 

outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 

2028 and over the longer run.  The projections were based on participants’ individual assessments of 

appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate.  Participants also 

provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated 

with their projections.  The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the 

meeting.  

Participants observed that inflation had moved up since the beginning of the year and remained 

somewhat above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.  Although participants generally 

assessed that this year’s tariff increases had put upward pressure on inflation, some remarked that 

 
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    7 

these effects appeared to have been somewhat muted to date relative to expectations from earlier in 

the year.  A few participants suggested that productivity gains may be reducing inflation pressures.  A 

couple of participants expressed the view that, excluding the effects of this year’s tariff increases, 

inflation would be close to target.  A few other participants, however, emphasized that progress of 

inflation toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective had stalled, even excluding the effects of this 

year’s tariff increases. 

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected that, given appropriate 

monetary policy, inflation would be somewhat elevated in the near term and would gradually return to 

2 percent thereafter.  Some participants noted that business contacts had indicated that they would 

raise prices over time because of higher input costs stemming from tariff increases.  Uncertainty 

remained about the inflation effects of this year’s increase in tariffs, though most participants 

expected these effects to be realized by the end of next year.  Some participants remarked that the 

labor market was not expected to be a source of inflationary pressure.  A couple of participants 

expected that the reduction in net migration would be associated with lower demand and lower 

inflation, and a couple of participants observed that continued productivity gains would likely reduce 

inflation pressures.  Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well 

anchored and that it was important they remain so to help return inflation to 2 percent.  Various 

participants stressed the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that longer-term inflation 

expectations remained well anchored.  A majority of participants emphasized upside risks to their 

outlooks for inflation, pointing to inflation readings moving further from 2 percent, continued 

uncertainty about the effects of tariffs, the possibility that elevated inflation proves to be more 

persistent than currently expected even after the inflation effects of this year’s tariff increases fade, or 

the possibility of longer-term inflation expectations moving up after a long period of elevated inflation 

readings.  Some participants remarked that they perceived less upside risk to their outlooks for 

inflation than earlier in the year. 

In their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that job gains had slowed and the 

unemployment rate had edged up.  Participants noted that the low level of estimated job gains over 

recent months likely reflected declines in growth of both labor supply and labor demand.  Participants 

noted low net immigration or changes in labor force participation as factors reducing labor supply.  As 

for factors that may be reducing labor demand, participants noted moderate economic growth or the 

effects of high uncertainty on firms’ hiring decisions.  Under these circumstances, participants cited a 

number of other indicators as helpful for assessing labor market conditions.  These included the 

unemployment rate, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, wage growth, the percentage of 

unemployed workers who find a job, the quits rate among employed workers, and the layoff rate.  

Participants generally assessed that recent readings of these indicators did not show a sharp 

 
8    September 16-17, 2025 

deterioration in labor market conditions.  A few participants, though, saw recently released labor 

market data, including revisions to previously released data and the BLS’s preliminary estimate of the 

payroll employment benchmark revision, as indicating that labor market conditions had been 

softening for longer than was previously reported. 

With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants generally expected that, under 

appropriate monetary policy, labor market conditions would be little changed or would soften 

modestly.  Several participants noted that the number of monthly job gains consistent with a stable 

unemployment rate had declined over the past year and would likely remain low, citing the large 

number of workers nearing retirement age or continued low net immigration.  Participants indicated 

that their outlooks for the labor market were uncertain and viewed downside risks to employment as 

having increased over the intermeeting period.  In support of this view, participants mentioned a 

number of indicators, including the following:  low hiring and firing rates, which are evidence of less 

dynamism in the labor market; concentrated job gains in a small number of sectors; and increases in 

unemployment rates for groups that have historically shown greater sensitivity to cyclical changes in 

economic activity, such as those for African Americans and young people.  Several participants saw 

continuing adoption of artificial intelligence as potentially reducing labor demand.  Some participants 

noted that survey responses indicated that household sentiment regarding the labor market had 

moved down.   

Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year relative to 

last year.  Regarding the household sector, participants noted that lower consumption growth had 

contributed to the slowdown in the growth of economic activity in the first half of the year.  Several 

participants remarked that recent data indicated some firming of consumption expenditures this 

quarter.  Some participants mentioned that households were showing greater price sensitivity, and 

several participants observed that high-income households were increasingly doing better, 

economically, than lower-income households.  Several participants noted continued weakness in the 

housing market, and a couple of participants mentioned the possibility of a more substantial 

deterioration in the housing market as a downside risk to economic activity.  For businesses, many 

participants noted strong high-tech investment.  Several participants noted that financial conditions 

were supportive of economic activity.  A few participants commented that the agricultural sector 

continued to face headwinds because of low crop prices and high input costs.     

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had risen 

recently and remained somewhat elevated, and that recent indicators suggested that growth of 

economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year.  While participants noted the 

unemployment rate remained low, they observed that it had edged up and job gains had slowed.  In 

addition, they judged that downside risks to employment had risen.  Against this backdrop, almost all 

 
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    9 

participants supported reducing the target range for the federal funds rate ¼ percentage point at this 

meeting.  Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting’s appropriate policy 

action reflected a shift in the balance of risks.  In particular, most participants observed that it was 

appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because 

they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that 

upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased.  A few participants stated there was 

merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported 

such a decision.  These participants noted that progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation 

objective had stalled this year as inflation readings increased and expressed concern that longer-term 

inflation expectations may rise if inflation does not return to its objective in a timely manner.  One 

participant agreed with the need to move policy toward a more neutral stance but preferred a 

½ percentage point reduction at this meeting.  All participants judged it appropriate to continue the 

process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.   

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants noted that, with the reduction in 

the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the Committee was well positioned to 

respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.  Participants observed that monetary 

policy was not on a preset course and would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the 

evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks.  Participants expressed a range of views about 

the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely future 

path of policy.  Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the 

remainder of this year.  Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions 

suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a 

cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes.   

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, 

participants generally judged that upside risks to inflation remained elevated and that downside risks 

to employment were elevated and had increased.  Participants noted that, in these circumstances, if 

policy were eased too much or too soon and inflation continued to be elevated, then longer-term 

inflation expectations could become unanchored and make restoring price stability even more 

challenging.  By contrast, if policy rates were kept too high for too long, then unemployment could rise 

unnecessarily, and the economy could slow sharply.  Against this backdrop, participants stressed the 

importance of taking a balanced approach in promoting the Committee’s employment and inflation 

goals, taking into account the extent of departures from those goals and the potentially different time 

horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with 

the Committee’s mandate.   

 
10    September 16-17, 2025 

Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and 

implementation of monetary policy.  A few participants stated that balance sheet reduction had 

proceeded smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves remaining abundant.  

Nevertheless, with reserves declining and expected to decline further, they noted that it was important 

to continue to monitor money market conditions closely and evaluate how close reserves were to their 

ample level.  In that context, a few participants noted that the SRF would help keep the federal funds 

rate within its target range and ensure that temporary pressures in money markets would not disrupt 

the ongoing reduction in Federal Reserve securities holdings to the level needed to implement 

monetary policy efficiently and effectively in the Committee’s ample-reserves regime. 

Committee Policy Actions 

In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators 

suggested that growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year.  To reflect 

developments in the labor market, they agreed to no longer characterize labor market conditions as 

solid and instead state that job gains had slowed and that the unemployment rate had edged up but 

remained low.  Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated and agreed to add 

that inflation had moved up.  They agreed that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides 

of its dual mandate and to add that downside risks to employment had risen to reflect their concerns 

about the labor market.   

In support of the Committee’s goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, almost all members 

agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent.  

One member voted against that decision, preferring to lower the target range ½ percentage point at 

this meeting.  Members agreed that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the 

federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the 

balance of risks.  All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong 

commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 

2 percent objective. 

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would 

continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  They would be 

prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede 

the attainment of the Committee’s goals.  Members also agreed that their assessments would take 

into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation 

pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. 

 
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    11 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective September 18, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: 

•  Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a 

target range of 4 to 4¼ percent. 

•  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 

4.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. 

•  Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate 

of 4 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. 

•  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 

holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of 

$5 billion per month.  Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and 

Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. 

•  Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 

agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar 

month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly 

match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. 

•  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for 

operational reasons.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the 

year.  Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.  

Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated. 

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 

over the longer run.  Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.  The 

Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that 

downside risks to employment have risen. 

In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided 

to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent.  

In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the 

 
12    September 16-17, 2025 

Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  

The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and 

agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee is strongly committed to supporting 

maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. 

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to 

monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  The Committee 

would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that 

could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.  The Committee’s assessments will 

take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, 

inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, 

Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, Jeffrey R. 

Schmid, and Christopher J. Waller.  

Voting against this action:  Stephen I. Miran. 

Governor Miran preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point at 

this meeting in light of further softening in the labor market over the first half of the year and 

underlying inflation that in his view was meaningfully closer to 2 percent than was apparent in the 

data.  Governor Miran also expressed the view that additional policy easing was also appropriate to 

reflect that the neutral rate of interest had fallen due to factors such as increased tariff revenues that 

had raised net national savings and changes in immigration policy that had reduced population 

growth. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4 to 

4¼ percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted to lower the interest rate 

paid on reserve balances to 4.15 percent, effective September 18, 2025.  The Board of Governors of 

the Federal Reserve System voted to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit 

rate to 4.25 percent, effective September 18, 2025.2 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, 

October 28–29, 2025.  The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on September 17, 2025. 

2 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San 
Francisco.  The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 4.25 percent primary 
credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on September 18, 2025, or the date such Reserve Banks inform 
the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. 
Louis were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.25 percent, effective September 
18, 2025.)

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday released the minutes from its recent meetings to review and determine the discount rates provided to depository institutions through the discount window. Today's minutes cover the Board meetings that occurred on August 18 and September 17, 2025.

The Board's process for setting the discount rate is distinct from the process the Federal Open Market Committee follows in setting the target range for the federal funds rate.

For media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by eleven Reserve Banks to
maintain the existing primary credit rate and request by one Reserve Bank to
decrease the rate; requests to renew secondary and seasonal credit formulas.

Existing rate and formulas approved.

August 18, 2025.

Today, Board members discussed economic and financial developments and

issues related to possible policy actions. In connection with this discussion, Board
members considered discounts and advances made under the primary credit program
(the primary credit rate) and discussed, on a preliminary basis, their individual
assessments of the appropriate rate and its communication, which would be discussed
at the next joint meeting of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of
the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City,
and Dallas had voted on August 7, 2025, and the directors of the Federal Reserve
Banks of Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on
August 14, to establish the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent. The
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on August 7, 2025, to
establish the primary credit rate at 4.25 percent (a decrease from 4.5 percent). No
sentiment was expressed by the Board at today's meeting for changing the primary
credit rate at this time, and the Board approved the establishment of the primary credit
rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.

The Board's action today on the primary credit rate also included renewal of the
existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under
the secondary and seasonal credit programs. As specified by the formula for the
secondary credit rate, this rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary credit
rate. As specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, this rate would be reset
every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the rate on
three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points.

Voting for this action:  Chair Powell and Governors Waller, Cook, and Barr.

Absent: Vice Chair Jefferson
and Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman.

Background:

Office of the Secretary memorandum, August 15, 2025.

Implementation:

Transmissions from Mr. McDonough to the Reserve Banks,

MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION -- Decrease in the interest on reserve
balances rate and in the primary credit rate; renewal of secondary and seasonal
credit formulas.

Approved.
September 17, 2025.

In a joint meeting of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)

today, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis
points, to 4 to 4-1/4 percent, effective September 18, 2025. To support the FOMC's
decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board approved
lowering the interest rate paid on reserve balances from 4.4 percent to 4.15 percent,
effective September 18, 2025. At today's meeting, the Board also approved a 25-basis-
point reduction in the interest rate on discounts and advances made under the primary
credit program (the primary credit rate) to 4.25 percent.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of

ten Federal Reserve Banks had voted to establish a decrease in the primary credit rate.
The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago,
Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on September 4, 2025, and the directors of
the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted
on September 11, to establish the primary credit rate at 4.25 percent (a decrease from
4.5 percent). The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. Louis
had voted on September 4, 2025, to establish the primary credit rate at the existing level
of 4.5 percent.  At its meeting on August 18, 2025, the Board had taken no action on a
request by the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to decrease the
primary credit rate.

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally reported stable economic conditions,

but most also noted softening labor markets, weaker consumer demand, and continued
uncertainty related to tariffs. In labor markets, many directors observed that businesses
were being cautious about hiring, and several noted improved availability of job
applicants. In addition, many directors commented on the potential for artificial
intelligence to enhance productivity and put downward pressure on labor demand.
Several directors commented that consumers were becoming more price sensitive, and
some expressed concern over the potential effects of changes to Medicaid on
healthcare services.

At today's meeting, there was consensus for a 25-basis-point decrease, and the
Board approved a decrease in the primary credit rate from 4.5 percent to 4.25 percent,
effective September 18, 2025, for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San
Francisco. The Board's action today on the primary credit rate also included renewal of
the existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances
under the secondary and seasonal credit programs. As specified by the formula for the
secondary credit rate, this rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary credit
rate. As specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, this rate would be reset
every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the rate on
three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points.

It was understood that a press release and an accompanying document on
monetary policy implementation would be issued to announce the decreases in the
interest on reserve balances rate and the primary credit rate. In addition, the Secretary

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

Huntington Bancshares  Incorporated 
Columbus,  Ohio 

Order Approving the Merger  of Bank Holding Companies 

Huntington Bancshares  Incorporated (“Huntington”),  Columbus,  Ohio, a 

financial  holding company within the meaning  of the Bank Holding Company Act 

(“BHC Act”),1 has requested the Board’s approval  under section 3 of the BHC Act 2 to 

acquire  Veritex Holdings, Inc. (“Veritex”),  a financial  holding company,  and thereby 

indirectly acquire  Veritex’s  state member  bank subsidiary, Veritex Community  Bank 

(“Veritex Bank”), both of Dallas,  Texas.   Following  the proposed transaction, Veritex 

Bank would be merged with and into Huntington’s subsidiary  national bank, The 

Huntington National Bank (“Huntington Bank”), Columbus,  Ohio.3 

Notice of the proposal,  affording interested persons an opportunity to 

submit comments,  has been published (90 Federal Register  33379 (July  17, 2025)),  in 

accordance with the Board’s Rules of Procedure.4  The time for submitting  comments  has 

expired, and the Board has considered all  comments received.5  The  Board has 

considered the proposal  in light of the factors set forth in section 3 of the BHC Act.   

1  12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq. 
2  12 U.S.C. § 1842. 
3  The merger  of Veritex Bank with and into Huntington Bank is subject  to the approval 
of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), under section 18(c) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance  Act.  12 U.S.C. § 1828(c) (“Bank Merger  Act”).  The  OCC 
approved the Bank Merger  Act application on August 28, 2025. 
4  12 CFR 262.3(b). 
5  The Board received one comment in support of the proposal. 

 
 
 
 
 
- 2 - 

Huntington, with consolidated assets of approximately  $207.7 billion,  is the 

23rd largest insured depository organization  in the United States.6  Huntington controls 

approximately  $165.6 billion  in consolidated deposits, which represent  less than 

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

States.  Huntington controls  Huntington Bank, which operates in Colorado, Florida, 

Illinois,  Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,  Minnesota, North Carolina,  Ohio, Pennsylvania, 

South Carolina,  West Virginia,  and Wisconsin.    

Veritex, with consolidated assets of approximately  $12.5 billion,  is the 

134th largest insured depository organization  in the United States.  Veritex controls 

approximately  $10.7 billion  in consolidated deposits, which represent  less than 1 percent 

of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United States.  

Veritex controls Veritex Bank, which operates in Texas.    

On consummation  of this proposal,  Huntington would become the 20th 

largest insured depository organization  in the United States, with consolidated assets of 

approximately  $220.3 billion,  which would represent less  than 1 percent of the total 

assets of insured depository organizations  in the United States.  Huntington would control 

total consolidated deposits of approximately  $176.3 billion,  which would represent less 

than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the 

United States.   

Interstate  Analysis 

Section 3(d) of the BHC Act generally provides that, if certain conditions 

are met, the Board may approve  an application  by a bank holding company  that is well 

capitalized and well managed to acquire control of a bank located in a state other than the 

home state of the bank holding company  without regard to whether the transaction is 

6  Consolidated asset data are as of June 30, 2025.  Ranking, consolidated national 
deposit, and market share data are as of March 31, 2025.  In this context, insured 
depository institutions include commercial  banks, savings associations,  and savings 
banks.

prohibited under state law.7  The Board may not approve under this provision  an 

application  that would permit an out-of-state bank holding company to acquire  a bank in 

a host state if the target bank has not been in existence for the lesser  of the state statutory 

minimum  period of time or five years.8  When determining  whether to approve an 

application  under this provision,  the Board must take into account the record of the 

applicant’s  depository institution under the Community  Reinvestment Act of 1977 

(“CRA”)9 and the applicant’s  record of compliance  with applicable  state community 

reinvestment  laws.10  In addition, the Board may not approve an interstate application 

under this provision  if the bank holding company  controls or, upon consummation  of the 

proposed transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total deposits of insured 

depository institutions in the United States or, in certain circumstances,  if the bank 

holding company, upon consummation,  would control 30 percent or more  of the total 

deposits of insured depository institutions  in any state in which the acquirer  and target 

have overlapping  banking  operations.11   

For purposes of this provision,  the home state of Huntington is Ohio.12  

Veritex Bank is located in Texas.   Huntington is well capitalized and well managed under 

7  12 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(1)(A).    

8  12 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(1)(B). 
9  12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq. 
10  12 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(3).    
11  12 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(2)(A)  and (B).  Under section 3(d) of the BHC Act, the acquiring 
and target organizations  have overlapping  banking operations  in any state in which any 
bank to be acquired is located and the acquiring  bank holding company controls  any 
insured depository institution or a branch.   For purposes  of section 3(d) of the BHC Act, 
the Board considers a bank to be located in the states in which the bank is chartered or 
headquartered or operates a branch.  See 12 U.S.C. § 1841(o)(4)–(7). 
12  12 U.S.C. § 1841(o)(4).   A bank holding company’s  home state is the state in which 
the total deposits of all banking  subsidiaries  of such company were the largest on 
July 1, 1966, or the date on which the company became  a bank holding company, 
whichever  is later.

applicable  law.  Huntington Bank has an “Outstanding” rating under the CRA.13  Veritex 

Bank has been in existence for more  than five years.  

On consummation  of the proposed transaction, Huntington would control 

less than 1 percent of the total amount of consolidated deposits in insured depository 

institutions in the United States.  Huntington and Veritex do not have overlapping 

banking operations  in any state for purposes  of section 3(d).  Accordingly, in light of all 

the facts of record, the Board is not precluded from approving  the proposal  under section 

3(d) of the BHC Act. 

Competitive  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act prohibits the Board from approving  a proposal 

that would result in a monopoly  or would be in furtherance of an attempt to monopolize 

the business  of banking in any relevant  market.14  The BHC Act also prohibits  the Board 

from approving  a proposal  that would substantially lessen  competition  or tend to create a 

monopoly  in any banking  market, unless  the anticompetitive  effects of the proposal are 

clearly  outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the proposal in meeting 

the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.15 

Huntington Bank and Veritex Bank do not compete directly in any banking 

market.  The  U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) conducted a review of the potential 

competitive  effects of the proposal and has advised the Board that it did not conclude that 

the proposal  would have a significantly  adverse effect on competition.  In addition, the 

appropriate  banking agencies  have been afforded an opportunity to comment and have 

not objected to the proposal. 

13  Two of the jurisdictions  in which Huntington operates  branches—Illinois  and West 
Virginia—  have community  reinvestment  laws.  See 205 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 735/35-1 
et seq.; W. Va. Code §§ 31A-8B-1 et seq.  The state community  reinvestment  laws of 
Illinois  and West Virginia  do not apply to Huntington or Huntington Bank. 

14  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(A).   
15  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(B). 

 
 
- 5 - 

Based on all the facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation  of 

the proposal  would not have a significantly  adverse effect on competition or on the 

concentration of resources  in any relevant banking  market.  Accordingly, the Board 

determines that competitive  considerations are consistent with approval. 

Financial,  Managerial,  and Other Supervisory  Considerations 

In reviewing  a proposal  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the financial  and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the 

institutions involved, the effectiveness of the institutions in combatting money 

laundering,  and any public comments  on the proposal.16  In its evaluation  of financial 

factors, the Board reviews  information regarding  the financial  condition of the 

organizations  involved on both parent-only  and consolidated bases, as well as 

information  regarding the financial  condition of the subsidiary  depository institutions  and 

the organizations’  significant  nonbanking operations.   In this evaluation,  the Board 

considers a variety of public and supervisory  information regarding  capital adequacy, 

asset quality, liquidity, and earnings  performance,  as well as any public comments  on the 

proposal.   The Board evaluates  the financial  condition of the combined organization, 

including its capital position,  asset quality,  liquidity, earnings  prospects, and the impact 

of the proposed funding of the transaction.  The Board also considers  the ability of the 

organization  to absorb the costs of the proposal and to complete the proposed integration 

of the operations of the institutions effectively.  In assessing  financial  factors, the Board 

considers capital  adequacy to be especially  important.   The Board considers the future 

prospects of the organizations  involved in the proposal  in light of their financial  and 

managerial  resources  and the proposed business  plan. 

Huntington, Veritex, and their subsidiary  depository institutions are well 

capitalized, and the combined organization  would remain  so upon consummation  of the 

proposal.   The proposed transaction is a bank holding company  merger  that is structured 

16  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2),  (5), and (6). 

 
 
- 6 - 

as a share or cash exchange.17  The capital,  asset quality,  earnings,  and liquidity of 

Huntington are consistent with approval,  and Huntington and Huntington Bank appear to 

have adequate resources  to absorb the related costs of the proposal and to complete the 

integration of the institutions’  operations.  In addition, the future prospects of the 

institutions are considered consistent with approval.    

The Board also has considered the managerial  resources  of the 

organizations  involved and of the proposed combined organization.   The Board has 

reviewed the examination  records of Huntington, Veritex, and their subsidiary  depository 

institutions, including  assessments  of their management,  risk-management  systems, and 

operations.   In addition, the Board has considered information  provided by Huntington; 

the Board’s supervisory  experiences  and those of other relevant bank supervisory 

agencies  with the organizations;  and the organizations’  records of compliance  with 

applicable  banking, consumer  protection, and anti-money-laundering  laws.   

Huntington, Veritex, and their subsidiary  depository institutions are each 

considered to be well managed.  The  combined organization’s  proposed directors and 

senior  executive officers have knowledge of and experience in the banking and financial 

services  sectors,  and Huntington’s risk-management  program  appears  consistent with 

approval  of this proposal. 

The Board also has considered Huntington’s plans  for implementing  the 

proposal.   Huntington has conducted comprehensive  due diligence and is devoting 

sufficient financial  and other resources  to address all aspects of the post-acquisition 

integration process  for this proposal.   In addition, Huntington’s management  has the 

experience  and resources  to operate the resulting  organization  in a safe and sound 

manner,  and Huntington plans to integrate Veritex Bank’s existing  management  and 

personnel  in a manner  that augments Huntington’s management.   

17  To effect the transaction, each share  of Veritex common  stock would be converted into 
a right to receive  shares of Huntington common  stock based on an exchange  ratio, plus 
cash in lieu of any fractional  shares and Veritex stock options.  Huntington has the 
financial  resources  to effect the proposed transaction. 

 
 
- 7 - 

Based on all the facts of record, including  Huntington’s and Veritex’s 

supervisory  records, managerial  and operational  resources,  and plans for operating  the 

combined organization  after consummation,  the Board determines that considerations 

relating  to the financial and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the 

organizations  involved in the proposal,  as well as the records of effectiveness of 

Huntington and Veritex in combatting money-laundering  activities,  are consistent with 

approval.   

Convenience  and Needs Considerations   

In acting on a proposal  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the effects of the proposal on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to 

be served.18  In evaluating whether the proposal  satisfies  the convenience  and needs 

statutory factor, the Board considers the impact that the proposal  will or is likely  to have 

on the communities  served by the combined organization.    

The Board reviews  a variety of information  to determine whether the 

relevant institutions’  records demonstrate a history of helping to meet the needs of their 

customers  and communities.   The Board also reviews  the combined institution’s post-

consummation  plans and the expected impact of those plans on the communities  served 

by the combined institution, including  on low- and moderate-income  (“LMI”) individuals 

and communities.   The Board considers whether the relevant institutions are helping  to 

meet the credit needs of the communities  they serve  and are providing access  to banking 

products and services  that meet the needs of customers  and communities,  including  the 

potential impact of branch closures,  consolidations,  and relocations  on that access.  In 

addition, the Board reviews the records of the relevant depository institutions under the 

CRA.19  The Board strongly encourages  insured depository institutions  to help meet the 

18  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2).   Where  applicable,  the Board also considers  any timely 
substantive comments  on the proposal  and, in its discretion, may consider any untimely 
substantive comments  on the proposal. 
19  12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq. 

 
 
- 8 - 

credit needs of the local communities  in which they operate, consistent with the 

institutions’  safe and sound operation and their obligations  under the CRA.20   

In addition, the Board considers the banks’ overall  compliance  records and 

recent fair lending examinations.   Fair lending laws require  all lending institutions to 

provide applicants  with equal access to credit, regardless  of their race, ethnicity, gender, 

or certain other characteristics.   The  Board also considers assessments  of other relevant 

supervisors,  the supervisory  views of examiners,  other supervisory  information, 

information  provided by the applicant,  and public comments  on the proposal.   The Board 

also may consider the acquiring  institution’s business  model and intended marketing and 

outreach, the combined organization’s  plans  after consummation,  and any other 

information  the Board deems relevant. 

In assessing  the convenience  and needs factor in this case, the Board has 

considered all  the facts of record, including reports of examination  of the CRA 

performance  of Huntington Bank and Veritex Bank; the fair lending and compliance 

records of both banks; the supervisory  views of the OCC, the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Dallas  (“Reserve  Bank”), and the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau (“CFPB”); 

confidential supervisory  information;  and information provided by Huntington.   

Records of Performance  under the CRA 

In evaluating the CRA performance  of the involved institutions,  the Board 

generally  considers each institution’s most recent CRA evaluation and the supervisory 

views of relevant federal supervisors,  which in this case is the OCC with respect to 

Huntington Bank and the Reserve Bank with respect to Veritex Bank.21  In addition, the 

Board considers information  provided by the applicant. 

The CRA requires  that the appropriate  federal financial  supervisor  for a 

depository institution prepare a written evaluation  of the institution’s record of helping  to 

20  See 12 U.S.C. § 2901(b).

- 9 - 

meet the credit needs of its entire community,  including LMI neighborhoods.22   An 

institution’s  most recent CRA performance  evaluation  is a particularly  important 

consideration  in the applications  process  because it represents  a detailed, on-site 

evaluation  by the institution’s  primary  federal supervisor  of the institution’s overall 

record of lending in its communities. 

In general,  federal financial  supervisors  apply a lending test (“Lending 

Test”),  an investment test (“Investment Test”),  and a service  test (“Service  Test”) to 

evaluate the performance  of large banks, such as Huntington Bank and Veritex Bank, in 

helping  to meet the credit needs of the communities  they serve.  The  Lending Test 

specifically  evaluates an institution’s  lending-related activities  to determine whether the 

institution is helping  to meet the credit needs of individuals and geographies  of all 

income  levels.   As part of the Lending Test, examiners  review and analyze  an 

institution’s  data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act of 1975 

(“HMDA”),23 in addition to small  business,  small  farm, and community  development 

loan data collected and reported under the CRA regulations, to assess  an institution’s 

lending activities  with respect to borrowers and geographies  of different income levels.    

The institution’s  lending performance  is evaluated based on a variety of 

factors, including  (1) the number and amounts of home mortgage, small  business,  small 

farm, and consumer  loans (as applicable)  in the institution’s  CRA assessment areas 

(“AAs”);  (2) the geographic  distribution of the institution’s lending, including the 

proportion  and dispersion of the institution’s lending in its AAs and the number and 

amounts of loans in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  geographies;  (3) the 

distribution of loans based on borrower  characteristics,  including,  for home mortgage 

loans, the number  and amounts of loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income 

22  12 U.S.C. § 2906. 
23 12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq. 

 
 
- 10 - 

individuals;24 (4) the institution’s  community  development lending, including the number 

and amounts of community development loans  and their complexity  and innovativeness; 

and (5) the institution’s use of innovative or flexible lending practices  to address the 

credit needs of LMI individuals and geographies.25   The Investment Test evaluates  the 

number  and amounts of qualified investments that benefit the institution’s  AAs.  The 

Service  Test evaluates the availability  and effectiveness of the institution’s systems  for 

delivering  retail banking  services  and the extent and innovativeness  of the institution’s 

community  development services.26    

CRA Performance  of Huntington  Bank 

Huntington Bank was assigned an overall  “Outstanding” rating at its most 

recent CRA performance evaluation  by the OCC, as of July 31, 2023 (“Huntington Bank 

Evaluation”).27   The bank received “Outstanding” ratings for each of the Lending, 

Service,  and Investment Tests.28 

24  Examiners  also consider the number  and amounts of small  business  and small  farm 
loans made to businesses  and farms with gross annual revenues  of $1 million  or less; 
small  business  and small  farm loans by loan amount at origination;  and consumer  loans, 
if applicable,  to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  individuals.  See, e.g., 
12 CFR 228.22(b)(3)  (2023). 
25  See 12 CFR 228.22(b) (2023). 

26  See 12 CFR 228.23 and 228.24 (2023). 
27  The Huntington Bank Evaluation was conducted using Large Institution CRA 
Examination  Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed HMDA-reportable  loan data, small loans 
to businesses  and farms, and community  development loans from January 1, 2020, 
through December 31, 2022.  
28  The Huntington Bank Evaluation involved a full-scope  review of the bank’s activities 
in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin  Multi-State  Metropolitan Statistical  Area (“MMSA”) 
(“Chicago  MMSA”);  Cincinnati OH-KY-IN MMSA (“Cincinnati  MMSA”); Weirton-
Steubenville  MMSA (“Weirton  MMSA”);  Youngstown-Warren-Boardman  MMSA 
(“Youngstown MMSA”) ; Denver-Aurora-Lakewood  Metropolitan  Statistical Area 
(“MSA”),  Colorado; Naples MSA, Florida;  Indianapolis MSA, Indiana; Detroit MSA, 
Michigan;  Flint MSA, Michigan;  Saginaw MSA, Michigan;  Minneapolis  MSA, 
Minnesota;  Cleveland MSA, Ohio;  Columbus MSA, Ohio; Toledo MSA, Ohio; 
Pittsburgh MSA, Pennsylvania;  Sioux Falls  MSA, South Dakota; West Virginia  Non-

 
 
 
- 11 - 

With respect to the Lending Test, the rating was primarily  based on 

Huntington Bank’s “Outstanding” Lending Test ratings  in ten rating areas,  including the 

two largest rating areas of Michigan  and Ohio, which account for 73.7 percent of 

Huntington Bank’s total deposits.  Huntington Bank received “High Satisfactory” ratings 

in three rating areas  and a “Low Satisfactory” rating in one rating area.  Examiners  found 

that lending levels  reflected at least adequate responsiveness  to credit needs in the bank’s 

AAs and that the bank exhibited at least an adequate geographic  distribution in its AAs.  

Examiners  found that Huntington National Bank offered multiple flexible and innovative 

retail service  products aimed at connecting consumers  and small  businesses  to account 

options and financing needs.  Examiners  also found that a substantial majority  of loans 

were located in its assessment  areas. 

The Investment Test rating was based on “Outstanding” ratings  in ten 

rating areas, including  Michigan  and Ohio.  The  bank received  “High Satisfactory” 

ratings in two rating areas  and “Low Satisfactory” ratings  in two rating areas.  Examiners 

found that the bank made at least adequate levels  of qualified investments,  grants, and 

donations in its AAs. 

The Service  Test rating was based on “Outstanding” ratings in six rating 

areas, including  Michigan  and Ohio.  The  bank received  “High Satisfactory” ratings  in 

five rating areas,  “Low Satisfactory” ratings in two rating areas,  and a “Needs to 

Improve” rating in its smallest  rating area, South Dakota.  Examiners  found that 

Huntington Bank’s delivery systems  were accessible  to a majority  of the bank’s AAs.  

CRA Performance  of Veritex  Bank 

Veritex Bank was assigned  an overall  “Satisfactory” rating at its most 

recent CRA performance evaluation  by the Reserve  Bank, as of June 17, 2024 (“Veritex 

MSA AA; and Milwaukee-Waukesha  MSA, Wisconsin.   Examiners  applied limited-
scope procedures to the remaining  assessment  areas. 

 
 
- 12 - 

Bank Evaluation”).29   Veritex Bank received “High Satisfactory” ratings for each of the 

Lending and Service  Tests and an ‘Outstanding” rating for the Investment Test.30  

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  found that Veritex Bank’s 

lending levels  reflected good responsiveness  to credit needs in the bank’s  AAs.  

Examiners  also found that the geographic distribution of loans reflected excellent 

penetration throughout the bank’s AAs and that the distribution of loans to individuals of 

different income levels  and businesses  of different sizes was good.  Examiners  also noted 

that Veritex Bank exhibited a good record of serving the credit needs of LMI individuals 

and areas and very small  businesses.   Examiners  observed that a substantial majority  of 

Veritex Bank’s loans were made in the bank’s AAs.  Examiners  also found that the bank 

made a relatively  high level  of community development loans  and made use of 

innovative  and/or flexible  lending practices  in serving  the AAs’ needs. 

With respect to the Investment Test, examiners  found that Veritex Bank 

made an excellent level  of qualified community  development investments  and grants, 

often in a leadership  position,  particularly  those that are not routinely  offered by private 

investors.   Examiners  also  found that the bank made significant use of innovative  and/or 

complex  investments  to support community  development initiatives.   Examiners 

29  The Veritex Bank Evaluation was conducted using Large Retail Institution CRA 
Examination  Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed home mortgage data and small business 
loan data from January 1, 2021, through December  31, 2022.  Examiners  also  reviewed 
community  development activities  from April 12, 2022, through June 17, 2024. 
30  The Veritex Bank Evaluation involved a full-scope  review  of the bank’s activities  in 
two of the bank’s AAs: Dallas-Fort  Worth, Texas;  and Houston, Texas MSA.  Examiners 
applied limited-scope  procedures  to the remaining  assessment  area.   

Examiners  noted that the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas  AA was given the most weight 

in Veritex Bank’s  evaluation, given  the bank’s stronger presence  and higher volume  of 
loans and deposits in the AA.  Additionally, because Veritex Bank’s small  business  loan 
volume  was larger  than its volume of HMDA lending, examiners  placed more weight on 
Veritex Bank’s small  business  lending when assessing  the bank’s CRA performance.   

 
 
- 13 - 

characterized  Veritex Bank as exhibiting  good responsiveness  to credit and community 

development needs. 

With respect to the Service Test, examiners  determined that Veritex Bank’s 

delivery systems  were accessible  to individuals of different income levels  throughout the 

bank’s AAs.  Examiners  found that, to the extent changes had been made, the bank’s 

record of opening and closing branches  had not adversely affected the accessibility of the 

bank’s delivery  systems, particularly  to LMI geographies  or to LMI individuals.  

Examiners  noted that services do not vary in a way that inconveniences  certain  portions 

of the bank’s AAs, particularly  in LMI geographies  and to LMI individuals.  Examiners 

also noted that Veritex Bank is a leader in providing community  development services. 

Additional  Supervisory  Views 

In its review of the proposal,  the Board consulted with and considered the 

views of the OCC as the primary  federal supervisor  of Huntington Bank and of the 

Reserve Bank as the primary  federal supervisor  of Veritex Bank.  The Board also 

considered the results  of the most recent consumer  compliance  examinations  of 

Huntington Bank and Veritex Bank, which included reviews  of the banks’ compliance 

management  programs  and their compliance  with consumer  protection laws and 

regulations,  including  fair lending.  The  Board also considered the results  of the most 

recent consumer  compliance  examination  of Huntington Bank by the CFPB. 

The Board has taken this information, as well as the CRA performance 

records of Huntington Bank and Veritex Bank, into account in evaluating  the proposal, 

including in considering  whether Huntington has the experience  and resources  to ensure 

that the combined organization  would help meet the credit needs of the communities  to 

be served following consummation  of the proposed transaction.   

Additional  Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board also considers  other potential effects of the proposal on the 

convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  This  includes, for example,  the 

combined organization’s  business  model and intended marketing and outreach and 

existing  and anticipated product and service offerings in the communities  to be served by 

 
- 14 - 

the organization;  any additional plans  the combined organization  has for meeting the 

needs of its communities  following consummation;  and any other information  the Board 

deems relevant.   

Huntington represents  that both Huntington and Veritex proactively  support 

the needs of their respective  communities  and that the combined organization  will 

continue to do so following consummation  of the proposal.  Huntington asserts  the 

customers  of Veritex Bank will gain access  to Huntington’s online  and mobile  banking 

platforms, as well as access to a significantly  broader set of product and service offerings, 

including deposit and loan products designed to benefit under-resourced populations  and 

communities,  an expanded suite of consumer lending, capital  markets, and wealth 

management  products, and insurance  products and services.   Huntington further 

represents  that, as a result of the transaction, customers  of both Huntington Bank and 

Veritex Bank will benefit from expanded products that would be offered throughout the 

combined branch network.  Huntington represents  that Huntington Bank and Veritex 

Bank have a number  of programs,  products, and activities  designed to meet their 

respective  communities.   Additionally, Huntington asserts  it is committed to continuing 

Veritex’s  strong legacy  of community support through local partnerships,  investment, and 

engagement.   

Branch Closures 

Physical  branches  remain  important to many banking  organizations’  ability 

to meet the credit needs of the local  communities  in which they operate.  When banking 

organizations  combine,  whether through acquisitions,  mergers,  or consolidations,  the 

combination  has the potential to increase  or to reduce consumers’  and small  businesses’ 

access  to available  credit and other banking services.   Although the Board does not have 

the authority to prohibit a bank from closing  a branch, the Board focuses on the impact of 

expected branch closures,  consolidations,  and relocations  that occur in connection with a 

proposal  on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served by the resulting 

 
- 15 - 

institution.  In particular,  the Board considers the effect of any closures,  consolidations, 

or relocations  on LMI communities.    

Federal banking law provides a specific  mechanism  for addressing branch 

closings,  including  requiring  that a bank provide notice to the public  and the appropriate 

federal supervisory  agency before a branch is closed.31  In addition, the federal banking 

supervisory  agencies  evaluate a bank’s  record of opening and closing  branches, 

particularly  branches  located in LMI geographies  or that primarily  service  LMI 

individuals, as part of the CRA examination  process.32 

Huntington represents  that Huntington Bank plans to retain Veritex Bank’s 

branches  and that no Veritex Bank branch  would be closed or consolidated in connection 

with the proposal.    

Conclusion  on Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board has considered all  the facts of record, including the records of 

the relevant depository institutions under the CRA, the institutions’ records of 

compliance  with fair lending and other consumer  protection laws, supervisory 

information,  information  provided by Huntington, and other potential effects of the 

proposal  on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  Based on that 

review, the Board determines that the convenience  and needs factor is consistent with 

approval. 

Financial  Stability  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act requires the Board to consider “the extent to 

which a proposed acquisition,  merger,  or consolidation would result in greater or more 

concentrated risks  to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.”33   

31  See 12 U.S.C. § 1831r-1.   The bank also is required to provide reasons  and other 
supporting  data for the closure, consistent with the institution’s written policy  for branch 
closings. 

32  See, e.g., 12 CFR 228.24(d)(2) (2023).   
33  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(7). 

 
 
- 16 - 

To assess  the likely  effect of a proposed transaction on the stability of the 

United States banking or financial  system, the Board considers a variety of metrics that 

capture the systemic  “footprint” of the resulting  firm and the incremental  effect of the 

transaction on the systemic  footprint of the acquiring firm.  These metrics  include 

measures  of the size of the resulting  firm, the availability  of substitute providers for any 

critical  products and services  offered by the resulting firm, the interconnectedness  of the 

resulting  firm with the banking or financial  system, the extent to which the resulting  firm 

contributes to the complexity  of the financial system,  and the extent of the cross-border 

activities  of the resulting firm.34  These  categories  are not exhaustive, and additional 

categories  could inform the Board’s decision.  In addition to these quantitative measures, 

the Board considers qualitative  factors, such as the opacity and complexity  of an 

institution’s  internal organization,  that are indicative of the relative  degree of difficulty of 

resolving  the resulting firm.  A financial institution that can be resolved in an orderly 

manner  is less likely  to inflict material  damage on the broader economy.35 

In this case, the Board has considered information  relevant to the risks  to 

the stability of the U.S. banking or financial  system.  The Board reviewed publicly 

available  data, data compiled through the supervisory  process,  and data obtained through 

information  requests to the institutions involved in the proposal,  as well as qualitative 

information. 

An organization’s  size is one important indicator of the risk that the 

organization  may pose to the U.S. banking or financial  system.  Congress  has imposed 

specific  size-based limitations  on the amount of deposits and liabilities  a banking 

34  Many of the metrics  considered by the Board measure  an institution’s activities 
relative  to the U.S. financial system.

Corporation,  FRB Order No. 2012-2 (Feb. 14, 2012).

organization  may control.36  Size is also among  the factors that the Board must take into 

consideration  in differentiating among  banking organizations  under section 165 of the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.37  The proposed 

acquisition  would increase  Huntington’s size only by approximately  6.0 percent as 

measured by total assets, with similar  impact as measured by deposits or total leverage 

exposures,  and the resulting firm  would still hold less than 1 percent of total U.S. 

financial  system assets.   

Analysis  of non-size  measures  of financial  stability risks  points to limited 

risks,  with de minimis  increases  in these measures  as a result of the acquisition.   The 

resulting  firm would not be a critical  services  provider or so interconnected with other 

firms or markets that it would pose significant risk  to the financial system in the event of 

financial  distress.  In addition, the resulting firm would have minimal  cross-border 

activities  and would not exhibit an organizational  structure, complex  interrelationships,  or 

unique characteristics  that would complicate  resolution  of the firm.38  

In light of all the facts and circumstances,  this transaction  would not appear 

to result in meaningfully  greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. 

banking or financial  system.  Based on these and all other facts of record, the Board 

determines that considerations  relating to financial  stability are consistent with approval. 

36  12 U.S.C. §§ 1842(d)(2)(A)  and 1852 (imposing  a 10 percent nationwide deposit limit 
and a 10 percent nationwide liabilities  limit  on potential combinations  by banking 
organizations). 
37  See 12 U.S.C. § 5365(a)(2)(A).   The  Board has previously  used size as a simple 
measure  of a banking organization’s  potential systemic  impact  and has differentiated the 
stringency  of capital and liquidity requirements  based on total consolidated asset size.   
38  In addition, the Board also considered the Global  Systemically  Important Bank (“G-
SIB”) method 1 score of the combined organization.   The  G-SIB method 1 score is a 
measure  of an institution’s  systemic  importance  and is a weighted sum of an institution’s 
indicators of size, interconnectedness,  complexity,  cross-jurisdictional  activity, and 
substitutability.   See 80 Federal Register  49082 (Aug. 14, 2015).  On consummation  of 
the proposal,  the Board estimates that Huntington’s G-SIB method 1 score would not 
increase  materially  and would remain  well below the threshold that identifies a financial 
institution as a G-SIB.

Conclusion 

Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board determines 

that the application  should be, and hereby is, approved.  In reaching its conclusion,  the 

Board has considered all the facts of record in light of the factors that it is required to 

consider under the BHC Act and other applicable  statutes.  The Board’s approval  is 

specifically  conditioned on compliance  by Huntington with all  the conditions imposed in 

this order and on any commitments  made to the Board in connection with the proposal.   

The Board’s approval  also is conditioned on receipt by Huntington of all required 

regulatory  approvals.   For purposes  of this action, the conditions and commitments  are 

deemed to be conditions imposed  in writing by the Board in connection with its findings 

and decision herein and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable  law. 

The proposal  may not be consummated before the 15th calendar day after 

the effective date of this order or later than three months thereafter, unless such period is 

extended for good cause by the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, acting 

under delegated authority. 

By order of the Board of Governors,39 effective October 3, 2025.

October 3, 2025 

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

BancFirst Corporation 
Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma 

Order Approving the Acquisition  of a Bank Holding Company and the Merger of Bank 
Holding Companies 

BancFirst Corporation  (“BANF”), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,  a financial 

holding company within the meaning  of the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”),1 

has requested the Board’s approval  under section  3 of the BHC Act 2 to acquire 

AmeriBank  Holding Company (“AmeriBank”),  and thereby indirectly acquire  its state 

nonmember  bank subsidiary,  American  Bank of Oklahoma (“ABOK”), both of 

Collinsville,  Oklahoma.   In addition, BANF has requested the Board’s approval  under 

section 3 of the BHC Act to acquire ABOK.  Following the proposed acquisition,  BANF 

would initially  operate ABOK as a separate bank and then merge ABOK with and into 

BANF’s subsidiary  state member  bank, BancFirst, Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma.3   

Notice of the proposal,  affording interested persons an opportunity to 

submit comments,  has been published (90 Federal Register  27017 (June  25, 2025)), in 

accordance with the Board’s Rules of Procedure.4  The time for submitting  comments  has 

expired, and the Board received one comment on the proposal.   The Board has considered 

the proposal  and the comment received in light of the factors set forth in section 3 of the 

BHC Act.  

1  12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq. 
2  12 U.S.C. § 1842. 
3  The merger  of ABOK into BancFirst, which is expected to occur a short time after 
BANF’s acquisition  of AmeriBank, is subject to the approval  of the Federal Reserve 
System under section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act.  12 U.S.C. § 1828(c).   
4  12 CFR 262.3(b).

BANF, with consolidated assets of approximately  $14.0 billion,  is the 

127th largest insured depository organization  in the United States.5  BANF controls 

approximately  $12.1 billion  in consolidated deposits, which represent  less than 1 percent 

of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United States.6  In 

addition to BancFirst, which operates only in Oklahoma,  BANF controls two other 

subsidiary  banks, Pegasus Bank, Dallas, Texas,  and Worthington Bank, Arlington,  Texas, 

both of which operate only in Texas.   BANF is the 3rd largest insured depository 

institution in Oklahoma, controlling  deposits of approximately  $9.4 billion,  which 

represent  approximately  6.8 percent of the total deposits of insured depository institutions 

in that state.   

AmeriBank,  with consolidated assets of approximately  $381 million,  is the 

2,042nd largest insured depository organization  in the United States.  AmeriBank 

controls approximately  $321 million  in consolidated deposits, which represent  less than 

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

States.  AmeriBank  controls ABOK, which operates only in Oklahoma.   AmeriBank  is 

the 74th largest insured depository institution in Oklahoma,  controlling  deposits of 

approximately  $311 million,  which represent  less than 1 percent of the total amount of 

deposits of insured depository institutions  in that state. 

On consummation  of this proposal,  BANF would become the 125th largest 

insured depository organization  in the United States, with consolidated assets of 

approximately  $14.4 billion,  which would represent less  than 1 percent of the total assets 

of insured depository organizations  in the United States.  BANF would control total 

consolidated deposits of approximately  $12.4 billion,  which would represent less  than

March 31, 2025. 
6  Consolidated national deposit and market share data are as of March 31, 2025.  State 
deposit data are as of June 30, 2024, unless  otherwise noted.  In this context, insured 
depository institutions include commercial  banks, savings associations,  and savings 
banks.

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

States.  BANF would remain the 3rd largest insured depository institution in Oklahoma, 

controlling  deposits of approximately  $9.7 billion,  which would represent approximately 

7.1 percent of the total deposits of insured depository institutions in that state.7 

Competitive  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act prohibits the Board from approving  a proposal 

that would result in a monopoly  or would be in furtherance of an attempt to monopolize 

the business  of banking in any relevant  market.8  The BHC Act also prohibits  the Board 

from approving  a proposal  that would substantially lessen  competition  or tend to create a 

monopoly  in any banking  market, unless  the anticompetitive  effects of the proposal are 

clearly  outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the proposal in meeting 

the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.9   

BANF and AmeriBank have subsidiary banks that compete directly in the 

Bartlesville,  Oklahoma,  banking market (“Bartlesville  market”);10  the Muskogee-

Tahlequah,  Oklahoma,  banking market (“Muskogee  market”);11  and the Tulsa, 

Oklahoma,  banking market (“Tulsa  market”).12   The Board has considered the 

7  The proposal  does not require  interstate analysis  under section 3(d) of the BHC Act 
because the home  state of BANF is Oklahoma, and ABOK is located only within 
Oklahoma.   See 12 U.S.C. §§ 1841(o)(4)–(7)  and 1842(d). 
8  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(A). 
9  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(B). 
10  The Bartlesville  market  is defined as Washington County, Oklahoma,  and Nowata 
County, Oklahoma,  minus  the South Coffeyville Wann Census County Division 
(“CCD”). 
11  The Muskogee  market is defined as Muskogee and Cherokee Counties, Oklahoma;  the 
Checotah CCD in McIntosh County, Oklahoma;  and the Stilwell West CCD and Stilwell 
East CCD in Adair County, Oklahoma. 
12  The Tulsa  market is defined as Tulsa, Creek, Okmulgee,  Osage, Mayes, Pawnee, 
Rogers, and Wagoner counties,  Oklahoma;  the Eufaula CCD, Hanna CCD, and Hitchita-
Pierce  CCD in McIntosh County, Oklahoma;  the Okemah CCD and Weleetka CCD in

competitive  effects of the proposal in these banking markets.   In particular,  the Board has 

considered the relative  share of total deposits in insured depository institutions in the 

markets  (“market deposits”) that BANF would control;13 the concentration level  of 

market deposits and the increase in this level,  as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman 

Index (“HHI”) under the 1995 Bank Merger  Competitive Review guidelines  (“1995 Bank 

Merger  Guidelines”);14  the number  of competitors that would remain in each market;  and 

other characteristics  of the market. 

Okfuskee County, Oklahoma;  the Vinita West CCD and Vinita East CCD in Craig 
County, Oklahoma;  and the Grove CCD in Delaware County, Oklahoma. 
13  Local deposit and market share data are as of June 30, 2024, and are based on 
calculations  in which the deposits of thrift institutions are included at 50 percent.  The 
Board previously  has indicated that thrift institutions have become, or have the potential 
to become, significant  competitors  to commercial  banks.  See, e.g., Midwest Financial 
Group, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin  386 (1989);  National City Corporation,  70 Federal 
Reserve Bulletin  743 (1984).   Thus, the Board regularly  has included thrift deposits in the 
market share  calculation  on a 50 percent weighted basis.  See, e.g., First Hawaiian, Inc., 
77 Federal Reserve  Bulletin 52 (1991).

Overview, https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2007/08/14/6472.pdf 
(1995).  On September 17, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced its 
withdrawal from the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines and emphasized that the 2023 Merger 
Guidelines,  issued on December 18, 2023, remain  its sole and authoritative statement 
across  all industries.  Press  Release, Department of Justice, “Justice  Department 
Withdraws from 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines,”  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-
department-withdraws-1995-bank-merger-guidelines.   The 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines 
had been adopted together with the federal banking agencies,  and none of the federal 
banking agencies  have withdrawn from the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines.   The Board 
continues to apply the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines in evaluating  bank merger 
proposals.   The  Board traditionally has considered a market unconcentrated if the post-
merger  HHI is under 1000, moderately concentrated if the post-merger  HHI is between 
1000 and 1800, and highly concentrated if the post-merger  HHI exceeds 1800.  See, e.g., 
Chemical  Banking Corporation,  78 Federal Reserve  Bulletin 74 (1992).   In addition, the 
Board has traditionally  considered a merger  not to have an anticompetitive  effect where 
the proposed merger  would not increase the HHI by more than 200 points in any banking 
market, in the absence of other factors indicating anticompetitive  effects. 

 
- 5 - 

Consummation  of the proposal  would be consistent with Board precedent 

and within the thresholds in the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines  in the Bartlesville  market, 

the Musgokee  market, and the Tulsa  market.  On consummation,  the Muskogee market 

and Tulsa  market would remain  moderately concentrated, and the changes in market 

concentrations  would be well within the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines  and Board 

precedent.  The  Bartlesville  market would remain  highly concentrated, as measured by 

the HHI, and the change in HHI in the market would be small.   Numerous  competitors 

would remain  in each of the markets.15 

15  BANF is the 2nd largest depository organization  in the Bartlesville  market, controlling 
approximately  $108.9 million  in deposits, which represent 9.73 percent of the market 
deposits.  AmeriBank  is the 10th largest depository organization  in the market, 
controlling  approximately  $20.8 million  in deposits, which represent 1.86 percent of 
market deposits.  On consummation  of the proposed transaction,  BANF would remain the 
2nd largest depository institution in the market, controlling  approximately  $129.6 million 
in deposits, which would represent 11.59 percent of market deposits.  The HHI for the 
Bartlesville  market would increase  by 36 points to 3816, and 10 competitors would 
remain  in the market. 

           BANF is the 4th largest depository organization  in the Muskogee market, 
controlling  approximately  $314.6 million  in deposits, which represent  11.02 percent of 
the market deposits.  AmeriBank is the 10th largest  depository organization  in the 
market, controlling  approximately  $80.8 million  in deposits, which represent  2.83 percent 
of market deposits.  On consummation  of the proposed transaction, BANF would become 
the 2nd largest depository institution in the market, controlling  approximately 
$395.4 million  in deposits, which would represent 13.85 percent of market deposits.  The 
HHI for the Muskogee market would increase  by 63 points to 1515, and 10 competitors 
would remain  in the market. 

           BANF is the 3rd largest depository organization  in the Tulsa  market, controlling 
approximately  $1.79 billion  in deposits, which represent  4.84 percent of the market 
deposits.  AmeriBank  is the 31st largest  depository organization  in the market, 
controlling  approximately  $209.4 million  in deposits, which represent  less than 1 percent 
of market deposits.  On consummation  of the proposed transaction, BANF would remain 
the 3rd largest depository institution in the market,  controlling  approximately 
$2.00 billion  in deposits, which would represent 5.41 percent of market deposits.  The 
HHI for the Tulsa market would increase  by 6 points to 1076, and 63 competitors would 
remain  in the market. 

 
- 6 - 

The DOJ conducted a review of the potential competitive  effects of the 

proposal  and has advised the Board that it did not conclude that the proposal would have 

a significantly  adverse effect on competition.  In addition, the appropriate banking 

agencies  have been afforded an opportunity to comment and have not objected to the 

proposal.   

Based on all the facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation  of 

the proposal  would not have a significantly  adverse effect on competition or on the 

concentration of resources  in any relevant banking  market.  Accordingly, the Board 

determines that competitive  considerations are consistent with approval. 

Financial,  Managerial,  and Other Supervisory  Considerations 

In reviewing  proposals  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the financial  and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the 

institutions involved, the effectiveness of the institutions in combatting money 

laundering,  and any public comments  on the proposal.16  In its evaluation  of financial 

factors, the Board reviews  information regarding  the financial  condition of the 

organizations  involved on both parent-only  and consolidated bases, as well as 

information  regarding the financial  condition of the subsidiary  depository institutions  and 

the organizations’  significant  nonbanking operations.   In this evaluation,  the Board 

considers a variety of public and supervisory  information regarding  capital adequacy, 

asset quality, liquidity, and earnings  performance,  as well as any public comments  on the 

proposal.   The Board evaluates  the financial  condition of the combined organization, 

including its capital position,  asset quality,  liquidity, earnings  prospects, and the impact 

of the proposed funding of the transaction.  The Board also considers  the ability of the 

organization  to absorb the costs of the proposal and to complete the proposed integration 

of the operations of the institutions effectively.  In assessing  financial  factors, the Board 

considers capital  adequacy to be especially  important.   The Board considers the future 

16  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2),  (5), and (6). 

 
- 7 - 

prospects of the organizations  involved in the proposal  in light of their financial  and 

managerial  resources  and the proposed business  plan.  

BANF and its subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized  and the 

combined organization  would remain  so upon consummation  of the proposal.   The 

proposed transaction is a bank holding company merger  that is structured as a share  and 

cash exchange.17  The capital,  asset quality, earnings,  and liquidity of BANF are 

consistent with approval,  and BANF appears to have adequate resources  to absorb the 

related costs of the proposal and to complete the integration  of the institutions’ operations 

as proposed.  In addition, the future prospects of the institutions are considered consistent 

with approval.   

The Board also has considered the managerial  resources  of the 

organizations  involved and of the proposed combined organization.   The Board has 

reviewed the examination  records of BANF, AmeriBank, and their subsidiary  depository 

institutions, including  assessments  of their management,  risk-management  systems, and 

operations.   In addition, the Board has considered information  provided by BANF; the 

Board’s supervisory  experiences  and those of other relevant bank supervisory  agencies 

with the organizations;  the organizations’  records of compliance  with applicable  banking, 

consumer  protection, and anti-money-laundering  laws; and the public comment  on the 

proposal.   

BANF and its subsidiary depository institutions are each considered to be 

well managed.  BANF’s senior  executive officers and principals  have knowledge of and 

experience  in the banking and financial  services  sectors,  and BANF’s risk-management 

program  appears  consistent with approval  of this proposal. 

17  BANF would effect the acquisition by acquiring  and merging  AmeriBank  with and 
into BANF, with BANF as the survivor.   At the time of the merger,  each share of 
AmeriBank  common  stock would be converted into a right to receive shares  of BANF 
common  stock based on an exchange ratio, cash, or some combination  of common stock 
and cash.  BANF has represented that it intends to merge ABOK with and into BancFirst 
at some time after the holding company transaction.   BANF has the financial  resources  to 
effect the proposed transaction.   

 
- 8 - 

The Board also has considered BANF’s plans for implementing  the 

proposal.   BANF has conducted comprehensive  due diligence and is devoting sufficient 

financial  and other resources  to address all aspects of the post-acquisition  integration 

process  for this proposal.   In addition, BANF’s management  has the experience  and 

resources  to operate the resulting  organization  in a safe and sound manner.   BANF plans 

to apply its risk-management  policies,  procedures, and controls at the combined holding 

company  following the transaction  

Based on all the facts of record, including  BANF’s supervisory  records, 

managerial  and operational  resources,  and plans for operating  the combined organization 

after consummation,  the Board determines that considerations relating  to the financial 

and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the organizations  involved in the 

proposal,  as well as the records of effectiveness of BANF and AmeriBank in combatting 

money-laundering  activities,  are consistent with approval.   

Convenience  and Needs Considerations   

In acting on a proposal  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the effects of the proposal on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to 

be served.18  In evaluating whether the proposal  satisfies  the convenience  and needs 

statutory factor, the Board considers the impact that the proposal  will or is likely  to have 

on the communities  served by the combined organization.   The  Board reviews a variety 

of information to determine whether the relevant institutions’  records demonstrate a 

history of helping  to meet the needs of their customers  and communities.   The Board also 

reviews  the combined institution’s post-consummation  plans and the expected impact of 

those plans  on the communities  served by the combined institution, including on low- and 

moderate-income  (“LMI”) individuals and communities.   The Board considers whether 

the relevant institutions  are helping to meet the credit needs of the communities  they 

18  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2).   Where  applicable,  the Board also considers  any timely 
substantive comments  on the proposal  and, in its discretion, may consider any untimely 
substantive comments  on the proposal.

serve and are providing access  to banking products and services  that meet the needs of 

customers  and communities,  including the potential impact of branch closures, 

consolidations,  and relocations  on that access.  In addition, the Board reviews the records 

of the relevant depository institutions under the Community  Reinvestment Act of 1977 

(“CRA”).19  The  Board strongly encourages  insured depository institutions to help meet 

the credit needs of the local communities  in which they operate, consistent with the 

institutions’  safe and sound operation and their obligations  under the CRA.20    

In addition, the Board considers the banks’ overall  compliance  records and 

recent fair lending examinations.   Fair lending laws require  all lending institutions to 

provide applicants  with equal access to credit, regardless  of their race, ethnicity, gender, 

or certain other characteristics.   The  Board also considers assessments  of other relevant 

supervisors,  the supervisory  views of examiners,  other supervisory  information, 

information  provided by the applicant,  and public comments  on the proposal.   The Board 

also may consider the acquiring  institution’s business  model and intended marketing and 

outreach, the combined organization’s  plans  after consummation,  and any other 

information  the Board deems relevant. 

In assessing  the convenience  and needs factor in this case, the Board has 

considered all  the facts of record, including reports of examination  of the CRA 

performance  of BancFirst, Pegasus Bank, Worthington Bank, and ABOK; the fair lending 

and compliance  records of these banks;  the supervisory  views of the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation  (“FDIC”), the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (“Kansas  City 

Reserve Bank”), and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  (“Dallas  Reserve Bank”); 

confidential supervisory  information;  information  provided by BANF; and the public 

comment  received on the proposal.

Public Comment on the Proposal 

The Board received one adverse comment  on the proposal.   The  commenter 

objected to the proposal,  alleging  that since 2021, including in 2023 and 2024, ABOK 

made fewer home loans  to African American  individuals  as compared to white 

individuals in Oklahoma. 21  The commenter  also alleged that ABOK denied home loan 

applications  of African American  individuals at a higher  rate than those of white 

individuals.22  Finally,  the commenter  alleged that BancFirst made fewer home loans  to 

African American  individuals as compared to white individuals in Oklahoma, and alleged 

that BancFirst denied home loan applications  of African American  individuals  at a higher 

rate than those of white individuals. 

Businesses  of the Involved  Institutions  and Response to the Public Comment 

Through  BancFirst, Pegasus  Bank, and Worthington Bank, BANF focuses 

on commercial  lending to businesses  of various  sizes and residential  real estate lending.  

These  products include deposit products such as checking,  savings,  money market, and 

certificate of deposit accounts; treasury management  services;  and consumer  and 

commercial  loans.  Through  ABOK, AmeriBank offers a variety of loan products, 

including commercial,  home mortgage,  agricultural,  and consumer  loans, primarily 

focusing on commercial  and home mortgage lending.  ABOK’s deposit products include 

checking,  savings,  money market, and certificate of deposit accounts.   

In response  to the comment, BANF represents that BancFirst’s loan 

origination  and approval  rates for African American  and Hispanic  populations  were 

21  The data cited by the commenter  corresponds to publicly  available  2023 and 2024 data 
reported by both banks under the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act of 1975 (“HMDA”), 
12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq. 
22  The commenter  requested the Board consider a 2023 settlement between ABOK and 
the DOJ (“DOJ Settlement”) regarding  allegations  that ABOK engaged in redlining in all 
majority-Black  and Hispanic  census tracts in four counties within the Tulsa,  Oklahoma, 
Metropolitan  Statistical Area.  The commenter  also  cited a decision where the court 
granted ABOK’s motion to strike certain language  from the DOJ’s complaint.   United 
States v. American  Bank of Oklahoma, No. 23-cv-371-CDL,  2023 WL 6393177 (N.D. 
Okla. Oct. 2, 2023).

higher  than those of peer institutions in Oklahoma based on HMDA data for 2023.  

BANF also represents  that BancFirst’s denial rates for African American  and Hispanic 

applicants  were less than those of peer institutions in Oklahoma  based on HMDA data for 

2023.  BANF asserts that BancFirst’s  “Satisfactory” CRA rating reflects BancFirst’s 

ongoing commitment  to meet the credit needs of its assessment  areas  (“AAs”).  BANF 

represents  that BancFirst offers a variety of mortgage lending services  and products in all 

locations  where BancFirst  operates, including in the areas  where ABOK currently has 

branch locations.   BANF states that BancFirst will  meet the needs of the communities  in 

which ABOK operates by expanding BancFirst’s  outreach.  Finally,  BANF represents 

that its staff are experienced and that it provides training  and conducts reviews for 

compliance  with fair lending laws. 

Records of Performance  under the CRA 

In evaluating the CRA performance  of the involved institutions,  the Board 

generally  considers each institution’s most recent CRA evaluation and the supervisory 

views of relevant federal supervisors,  which in this case are the FDIC with respect to 

ABOK, the Kansas City Reserve  Bank with respect to BancFirst, and the Dallas Reserve 

Bank with respect to Pegasus  Bank and Worthington Bank. 23  In addition, the Board 

considers information  provided by the applicant  and any public  commenters. 

The CRA requires  that the appropriate  federal financial  supervisor  for a 

depository institution prepare a written evaluation  of the institution’s record of helping  to 

meet the credit needs of its entire community,  including LMI neighborhoods.24   An 

institution’s  most recent CRA performance  evaluation  is a particularly  important 

consideration  in the applications  process  because it represents  a detailed, on-site 

evaluation  by the institution’s  primary  federal supervisor  of the institution’s overall 

record of lending in its communities. 

23  See Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment, 
81 Federal Register 48506, 48548 (July 25, 2016).   
24  12 U.S.C. § 2906. 

 
- 12 - 

In general,  federal financial  supervisors  apply a lending test (“Lending 

Test”),  an investment test (“Investment Test”),  and a service  test (“Service  Test”) to 

evaluate the performance  of large banks, such as BancFirst, in helping  to meet the credit 

needs of the communities  they serve.  The Lending Test specifically  evaluates an 

institution’s  lending-related activities  to determine whether the institution is helping  to 

meet the credit needs of individuals and geographies  of all income levels.   As part of the 

Lending Test, examiners  review and analyze  an institution’s  data reported under HMDA, 

in addition to small business,  small  farm, and community  development loan data 

collected and reported under the CRA regulations, to assess  an institution’s  lending 

activities  with respect to borrowers and geographies  of different income levels.   The 

institution’s  lending performance  is evaluated based on a variety of factors, including 

(1) the number  and amounts of home mortgage,  small  business,  small  farm, and 

consumer  loans  (as applicable)  in the institution’s CRA AAs; (2) the geographic 

distribution of the institution’s lending, including  the proportion and dispersion  of the 

institution’s  lending in its AAs and the number and amounts of loans in low-, moderate-, 

middle-, and upper-income  geographies;  (3) the distribution of loans based on borrower 

characteristics,  including,  for home mortgage loans,  the number and amounts of loans to 

low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  individuals;25  (4) the institution’s 

community  development lending, including the number  and amounts of community 

development loans and their complexity  and innovativeness;  and (5) the institution’s  use 

of innovative or flexible  lending practices  to address the credit needs of LMI individuals 

and geographies.26   The Investment Test evaluates  the number  and amounts of qualified 

investments  that benefit the institution’s AAs.  The Service  Test evaluates  the availability 

25  Examiners  also consider the number  and amounts of small  business  and small  farm 
loans made to businesses  and farms with gross annual revenues  of $1 million  or less, 
small  business  and small  farm loans by loan amount at origination,  and consumer loans, 
if applicable,  to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  individuals.  See, e.g., 
12 CFR 228.22(b)(3)  (2023). 
26  See 12 CFR 228.22(b) (2023).

and effectiveness of the institution’s  systems for delivering  retail  banking services  and 

the extent and innovativeness  of the institution’s community  development services.27    

Federal financial  supervisors  apply a streamlined  Lending Test 28 and a 

community  development test (“Community  Development  Test”)29 to evaluate the 

performance  of an intermediate small  bank, such as Worthington Bank or Pegasus Bank, 

in helping  to meet the credit needs of the communities  it serves.   The  Community 

Development  Test evaluates the number  and amounts of the institution’s  community 

development loans and qualified investments;  the extent to which the institution provides 

community  development services;  and the institution’s responsiveness  through such 

activities  to community  development lending, investment,  and service needs.30  Small 

institutions, such as ABOK, are subject only to a streamlined  Lending Test.31 

The Board is concerned when HMDA data reflect disparities in the rates of 

loan applications,  originations,  and denials among members  of different racial, ethnic, or 

gender groups  in local  areas.  These  types of disparities may indicate weaknesses  in the 

adequacy of policies  and programs  at an institution for meeting its obligations  to extend 

credit fairly.  However, other information critical  to an institution’s credit decisions  may 

not be available  from public HMDA data.32  Consequently, the Board considers 

additional information  not available  to the public  that may be needed from the institution 

27  See 12 CFR 228.23 and 228.24 (2023). 
28  See 12 CFR 228.26(a)(2)  and (b) (2023);  see also 70 Federal Register 44256 (Aug. 2, 
2005). 
29  See 12 CFR 228.26(a)(2),  (b), and (c) (2023). 
30  See 12 CFR 228.26(c)  (2023). 

31  See 12 CFR 228.26(a)(1)  and (b) (2023). 
32  Importantly, credit scores  are not available  in the public HMDA data.  Accordingly, 
when conducting fair lending examinations,  examiners  analyze additional information  not 
available  to the public before reaching  a determination regarding an institution’s 
compliance  with fair lending laws.

and evaluates disparities  in the context of the additional information obtained regarding 

the lending and compliance  record of an institution.   

CRA Performance  of BancFirst 

BancFirst was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its most recent 

CRA performance  evaluation by the Kansas City Reserve Bank as of July 15, 2024 

(“BancFirst  Evaluation”).33   The bank received a “Low Satisfactory” rating for the 

Lending Test and the Investment Test, and a “High Satisfactory” rating for the Service 

Test.34 

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  found that BancFirst’s lending 

levels  reflected good responsiveness  to AA credit needs.  Examiners  also found that a 

substantial  majority  of loans were originated in the bank’s AAs and that the geographic 

distribution of loans was adequate.  Examiners  stated that the bank’s distribution of loans 

among individuals  of different income levels,  including  LMI individuals, and businesses 

and farms of different sizes was adequate.  Examiners  also noted that BancFirst made a 

33  The BancFirst  Evaluation was conducted using Interagency Large Institution CRA 
Examination  Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed the bank’s HMDA-reportable,  small 
business,  and small  farm loans from January 1, 2020, through December  31, 2022.  
Examiners  also reviewed community  development loans  and services,  qualified 
investments,  and retail banking services  from March  9, 2021, through December  31, 
2022.  Qualified investments  made prior  to March 9, 2021, but still outstanding during 
this review period, were also considered. 
34  The BancFirst  Evaluation covered 11 AAs, which are all located in Oklahoma, 
including a full-scope  review of the bank’s activities  in its Central Oklahoma 
nonmetropolitan  AA; Eastern Oklahoma  nonmetropolitan  AA; Oklahoma City 
Metropolitan  Statistical Area (“MSA”) AA; Southern Oklahoma  nonmetropolitan  AA; 
and Tulsa,  Oklahoma,  MSA AA.  Examiners  noted that the Oklahoma City MSA and 
Tulsa  MSA AAs were given significantly  more  weight in the BancFirst Evaluation 
because of BancFirst’s  greater presence  in these AAs.  Examiners  also conducted a 
limited-scope  review of BancFirst’s activities  in its Kingfisher  County nonmetropolitan 
AA; Lawton MSA AA; Northern Oklahoma  nonmetropolitan  AA; Southeastern 
Oklahoma  nonmetropolitan  AA; Southwestern Oklahoma  nonmetropolitan  AA; and 
Washington  County nonmetropolitan  AA.

relatively  high level  of community  development loans and made use of innovative and 

flexible  lending practices  in order to serve AA credit needs.  

With respect to the Investment Test, examiners  found that BancFirst made 

an adequate level  of qualified community  development investments  and grants but was 

rarely  in a leadership  position.  Examiners  found that BancFirst occasionally  used 

innovative  and complex investments  to support community  development initiatives.   

Examiners  also found BancFirst exhibited adequate responsiveness  to credit and 

community  development needs. 

With respect to the Service Test, examiners  determined that BancFirst’s 

delivery systems  were accessible  to geographies  and/or individuals  of different income 

levels  in its AAs.  Examiners  found that the bank’s record of opening and closing of 

branches  had not adversely affected the accessibility  of its delivery systems,  particularly 

in LMI geographies  or to LMI individuals.  Examiners  also noted that products, services, 

and business  hours did not vary in a way that inconvenienced its AAs, particularly  LMI 

geographies  or LMI individuals.  Finally,  examiners  found that the bank provided a 

relatively  high level  of community  development services  within its AAs and is responsive 

to the available  service  opportunities.   

CRA Performance  of Pegasus  Bank 

Pegasus Bank was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its most 

recent CRA performance evaluation  by the Dallas  Reserve Bank, as of November  18, 

2024 (“Pegasus  Bank Evaluation”). 35   The bank received a “Satisfactory” rating for the 

Lending Test and an “Outstanding” rating for the Community  Development Test.  

35  The Pegasus  Bank Evaluation  was conducted using the Interagency Small  Institution 
CRA Examination  Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed the bank’s loan-to-deposit  ratio 
from April 1, 2020, to June 30, 2024, and the bank’s home mortgage,  small  business 
loan, and consumer  loan data from January 1, 2023, to December  31, 2023.  Examiners 
reviewed community  development lending, investment, and service  activities from 
August 3, 2020, to November 18, 2024.  The  Pegasus Bank Evaluation  involved a full-
scope review of the bank’s activities  in its only AA, the Dallas County Metropolitan  AA.  
The Dallas  County Metropolitan  AA is a portion of the Dallas-Plano-Irving  Metropolitan 

 
 
- 16 - 

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  found that Pegasus Bank’s 

average  net loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable,  given the bank’s asset size, financial 

condition, and the credit needs of the bank’s AA.  In addition, examiners determined that 

the majority  of Pegasus Bank’s loans  were made in its AA.  Examiners  found the bank’s 

lending reflected a reasonable  distribution of loans throughout the bank’s AA.  

Examiners  also found that the bank had a reasonable distribution of loans among 

individuals of different income levels,  including LMI individuals, and businesses  of 

different sizes.  Finally,  examiners  found that the bank had taken appropriate action in 

response  to substantiated complaints  regarding its performance  in helping to meet the 

credit needs of its AA.   

With respect to the Community Development  Test, examiners  found that 

the bank demonstrated excellent responsiveness  to community  development needs 

through qualified loans,  investments,  and services.   

CRA Performance  of Worthington  Bank 

Worthington Bank was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its 

most recent CRA performance  evaluation  by the Dallas  Reserve Bank, as of April 7, 

2025 (“Worthington Bank Evaluation”). 36  The bank received  a “Satisfactory” rating for

36  The Worthington  Bank Evaluation was conducted using the Interagency Small 
Institution CRA Examination Procedures.   Examiners  reviewed Worthington Bank’s 
loan-to-deposit ratio from April 1, 2018, to December  31, 2024, and its home mortgage 
and small  business  loans from January  1, 2023, to December  31, 2023.  Examiners  noted 
that more weight was given to small  business  lending rather than HMDA-reportable 
lending, as the bank is primarily  a commercial  lender.  Examiners  also reviewed qualified 
community  development lending, investment, and service  activities  from August 7, 2018, 
to April 7, 2025.  The Worthington Bank Evaluation covered a full-scope  review of 
Worthington Bank’s only AA, the DFW Metropolitan  AA, which consists  of Denton and 
Tarrant  counties.  Denton County is part of the Dallas-Plano-Irving,  TX Metropolitan

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  found that Worthington 

Bank’s average  net loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable,  given the bank’s asset size, 

financial  condition, and the credit needs of the bank’s AA.  In addition, examiners 

determined that the majority  of Worthington Bank’s loans  originated in the AA.  

Examiners  found the bank’s lending reflected a reasonable  distribution of loans 

throughout the bank’s  AA.  Examiners  also found that the bank had a reasonable 

distribution of loans among individuals  of different income levels,  including LMI 

individuals, and businesses  of different sizes.  Finally,  examiners  found that the bank did 

not receive  any CRA-related complaints  during the evaluation  period.   

With respect to the Community Development  Test, examiners  found that 

the bank demonstrated excellent responsiveness  to the needs of its AA through qualified 

loans, investments,  and services.   

CRA Performance  of ABOK 

ABOK was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its most recent 

CRA performance  evaluation by the FDIC, as of May 6, 2024 (“ABOK Evaluation”). 37  

The bank received a “Satisfactory” rating for the Lending Test. 

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  found that ABOK’s loan-to-

deposit ratio is more than reasonable  given ABOK’s size, financial  condition, and its 

AAs’ credit needs.  In addition, examiners determined that the majority  of the bank’s 

loans were within its AAs.  Examiners  found the bank’s geographic  distribution of loans 

reflects a reasonable  distribution of loans throughout its AAs.  Examiners  also found that, 

MD, but the AA excludes the Collin,  Dallas,  Ellis,  Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall 
counties that are part of this MD.  Tarrant  County is part of the Fort Worth-Arlington-
Grapevine,  TX MD, but the AA excludes the Johnson, Parker,  and Wise counties that are 
part of this MD. 
37  The ABOK Evaluation was conducted using Interagency Small  Institution CRA 
Examination  Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed the bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio from 
March 31, 2021, to December  31, 2023, and home mortgage and commercial  loan data 
from January 26, 2021, to December  31, 2023.  The ABOK Evaluation involved a full-
scope review of the bank’s activities  in its Tulsa,  Oklahoma,  MSA AA and a limited-
scope review of the Oklahoma  non-MSA AA. 

 
- 18 - 

given the demographics  of the AAs, the bank’s distribution of loans to borrowers  reflects 

reasonable  penetration among individuals of different income levels,  including LMI 

individuals, and businesses  of different sizes.  Finally,  examiners  noted that the bank did 

not receive  any CRA-related complaints  during the evaluation  period.  

Additional  Supervisory  Views 

In its review of the proposal,  the Board consulted with and considered the 

views of the FDIC as the primary  federal supervisor  of ABOK, of the Kansas City 

Reserve Bank as the primary  federal supervisor  of BancFirst, and of the Dallas Reserve 

Bank as the primary  federal supervisor  of Pegasus Bank and Worthington Bank.  The 

Board also considered the results  of the most recent consumer  compliance  examinations 

of BancFirst, Pegasus Bank, Worthington Bank, and ABOK, which included reviews of 

the banks’ compliance  management  programs  and their compliance  with consumer 

protection laws and regulations,  including fair lending. 38   

The Board has taken this information, as well as the CRA performance 

records of BancFirst, Pegasus Bank, Worthington Bank, and ABOK, into account in 

evaluating  the proposal,  including in considering  whether BANF has the experience  and 

resources  to ensure  that the combined organization  would help meet the credit needs of 

the communities  to be served following consummation  of the proposed transaction. 

Additional  Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board also considers  other potential effects of the proposal on the 

convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  This  includes, for example,  the 

combined organization’s  business  model and intended marketing and outreach and 

existing  and anticipated product and service offerings in the communities  to be served by 

38  Regarding the DOJ Settlement referenced by the commenter,  ABOK and the DOJ

6393177 (N.D. Okla. Aug. 23, 2023).  The  Board has considered information provided by 
BANF, reviewed confidential supervisory  information, and consulted with the FDIC and 
DOJ with respect to ABOK’s lending practices.

the organization;  any additional plans  the combined organization  has for meeting the 

needs of its communities  following consummation;  and any other information  the Board 

deems relevant.   

BANF represents that it does not expect any discontinuation in products 

and services  for continuing  customers of BancFirst or for customers  of ABOK resulting 

from the proposed transaction,39 and that customers of ABOK will be able to access the 

full range of products and services offered by BancFirst.  BANF states that customers 

will benefit from the combined organization’s  expanded network of branches and ATMs; 

access  to the combined bank’s  expanded loan capacity;  access to expanded cash-

management  services,  mortgage-lending  services,  Small  Business Administration  loans, 

treasury-management  services,  and trust services. 

Branch Closures 

Physical  branches  remain  important to many banking  organizations’  ability 

to meet the credit needs of the local  communities  in which they operate.  When banking 

organizations  combine,  whether through acquisitions,  mergers,  or consolidations,  the 

combination  has the potential to increase  or to reduce consumers’  and small  businesses’ 

access  to available  credit and other banking services.   Although the Board does not have 

the authority to prohibit a bank from closing  a branch, the Board focuses on the impact of 

expected branch closures,  consolidations,  and relocations  that occur in connection with a 

proposal  on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served by the resulting 

institution.  In particular,  the Board considers the effect of any closures,  consolidations, 

or relocations  on LMI communities.   

Federal banking law provides a specific  mechanism  for addressing branch 

closings,  including  requiring  that a bank provide notice to the public  and the appropriate

federal supervisory  agency before a branch is closed.40  In addition, the federal banking 

supervisory  agencies  evaluate a bank’s  record of opening and closing  branches, 

particularly  branches  located in LMI geographies  or that primarily  service  LMI 

individuals, as part of the CRA examination  process.41 

BANF represents that it does not presently anticipate any branch closures 

or consolidations  in connection  with the proposal.   

Conclusion  on Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board has considered all  the facts of record, including the records of 

the relevant depository institutions under the CRA, the institutions’ records of 

compliance  with fair lending and other consumer  protection laws, supervisory 

information,  information  provided by BANF, the public comment on the proposal,  and 

other potential effects of the proposal on the convenience  and needs of the communities 

to be served.  Based on that review, the Board determines that the convenience and needs 

factor is consistent with approval.    

Financial  Stability  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act requires the Board to consider “the extent to 

which a proposed acquisition,  merger,  or consolidation would result in greater or more 

concentrated risks  to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.”42 

To assess  the likely  effect of a proposed transaction on the stability of the 

United States banking or financial  system, the Board considers a variety of metrics that 

capture the systemic  “footprint” of the resulting  firm and the incremental  effect of the 

transaction on the systemic  footprint of the acquiring firm.  These metrics  include 

measures  of the size of the resulting  firm, the availability  of substitute providers for any 

critical  products and services  offered by the resulting firm, the interconnectedness  of the 

40  See 12 U.S.C. § 1831r-1.   The bank also is required to provide reasons  and other 
supporting  data for the closure, consistent with the institution’s written policy  for branch 
closings. 

41  See, e.g., 12 CFR 228.24(d)(2) (2023).  
42  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(7). 

 
- 21 - 

resulting  firm with the banking or financial  system, the extent to which the resulting  firm 

contributes to the complexity  of the financial system,  and the extent of the cross-border 

activities  of the resulting firm.43  These  categories  are not exhaustive, and additional 

categories  could inform the Board’s decision.   

In addition to these quantitative measures,  the Board considers  qualitative 

factors, such as the opacity and complexity of an institution’s  internal  organization,  that 

are indicative of the relative degree of difficulty of resolving the resulting  firm.  A 

financial  institution that can be resolved in an orderly manner is less  likely  to inflict 

material  damage on the broader economy.44 

The Board’s experience  has shown that proposals  involving  an acquisition 

of less than $10 billion  in total assets, or that result in a firm with less than $100 billion  in 

total assets, generally  are not likely  to pose systemic  risks.   Accordingly, the Board 

presumes  that a proposal  does not raise  material  financial  stability concerns  if the assets 

involved fall below either of these size thresholds, absent evidence that the transaction 

would result in a significant increase  in interconnectedness,  complexity,  cross-border 

activities,  or other risk factors.45 

In this case, the Board has considered information  relevant to risks  to the 

stability of the United States banking or financial  system.  The  proposal  involves  a target 

with less than $10 billion  in total assets and a pro forma organization  with less than 

$100 billion  in total assets.  Both the acquirer  and the target are predominantly  engaged 

43  Many of the metrics  considered by the Board measure  an institution’s activities 
relative  to the United States financial system. 
44  For further discussion  of the financial stability  standard, see Capital One Financial 
Corporation,  FRB Order No. 2012-2 (February  14, 2012). 
45  See People’s  United Financial,  Inc., FRB Order No. 2017-08 at 25–26 
(March  16, 2017).  Notwithstanding this presumption,  the Board has the authority to 
review the financial  stability  implications  of any proposal.   For example,  an acquisition 
involving  a global systemically  important bank could warrant a financial  stability review 
by the Board, regardless  of the size of the acquisition.

in retail and commercial  banking  activities.46  The  pro forma organization  would not 

exhibit an organizational  structure, complex  interrelationships,  or unique characteristics 

that would complicate resolution  of the firm in the event of financial distress.  In 

addition, the organization  would not be a critical  services  provider or so interconnected 

with other firms  or the markets  that it would pose a significant  risk to the financial  system 

in the event of financial distress.  

In light of all the facts and circumstances,  this transaction  would not appear 

to result in meaningfully  greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United 

States banking or financial  system.  Based on these and all other facts of record, the 

Board determines that considerations relating  to financial  stability are consistent with 

approval.   

Conclusion 

Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board determines 

that the proposal should be, and hereby is, approved.47  In reaching  its conclusion,  the 

46  BANF and AmeriBank offer a range of retail and commercial  banking  products and 
services.   BANF has, and as a result of the proposal  would continue to have, a small 
market share  in these products and services  on a nationwide basis. 
47  The commenter  requested that the Board hold public hearings  on the proposal.   Under 
section 3(b) of the BHC Act, the Board must hold a public hearing  on a proposal  if the 
appropriate  supervisory  authorities  for the acquiring  bank or the bank to be acquired 
make a timely written recommendation  of disapproval  of the proposal.   
12 U.S.C. § 1842(b);  see also 12 CFR 225.16(e).  The  Board has not received such a 
recommendation  from the appropriate  supervisory  authorities.  Under its rules, the Board, 
in its discretion, may hold a public hearing  if appropriate  to allow interested persons  an 
opportunity to provide relevant  testimony when written comments  would not adequately 
present their views.  The Board has considered the commenter’s  request in light of all the 
facts of record.  In the Board’s view, the commenter  has had ample opportunity to submit 
comments  on the proposal  and, in fact, submitted a written comment  that the Board has 
considered in acting on the proposal.   The  commenter’s  request does not identify disputed 
issues  of fact that are material  to the Board’s decision and would be clarified by a public 
hearing.   In addition, the request does not demonstrate why written comments  do not 
present the commenter’s  views adequately or why a hearing  otherwise would be 
necessary  or appropriate.   For these reasons,  and based on all the facts of record, the 

 
 
- 23 - 

Board has considered all the facts of record in light of the factors that it is required to 

consider under the BHC Act and other applicable  statutes.  The Board’s approval  is 

specifically  conditioned on compliance  by BANF with all the conditions imposed in this 

order and on any commitments  made to the Board in connection with the proposal.   The 

Board’s approval also  is conditioned on receipt by BANF of all required regulatory 

approvals.   For purposes  of this action, the conditions and commitments  are deemed to be 

conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection  with its findings and decision 

herein  and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable  law. 

The proposal  may not be consummated before the 15th calendar day after 

the effective date of this order or later than three months thereafter, unless such period is  

extended for good cause by the Board or the Kansas City Reserve Bank, acting under 

delegated authority. 

By order of the Board of Governors,48 effective October 3, 2025. 

(Signed) Michele Taylor Fennell 

Michele  Taylor  Fennell 
Associate Secretary  of the Board 

Board has determined that a public hearing  is not required or warranted in this case.  
Accordingly, the request for public  hearings  on the proposal  is denied. 

           The commenter  also requested an extension of the comment  period for the 
application.   The  commenter’s  request for additional time to comment did not identify 
circumstances  that would warrant an extension  of the public comment period for this 
proposal.   Accordingly,  the Board has determined not to extend the comment period.

FRB Order No. 2025-16 

October 16, 2025 

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

HPB Holdings, Inc. 
Okeene, Oklahoma 

Order Approving the Acquisition  of a Bank 

HPB Holdings, Inc. (“HPB”),1 Okeene, Oklahoma, a bank holding 

company  within the meaning  of the Bank Holding Company  Act (“BHC Act”),2 has 

requested the Board’s approval  under section 3 of the BHC Act 3 to acquire 100 percent of 

the voting shares of Community Bank, Alva, Oklahoma, a state nonmember  bank.  

Following  the proposed acquisition,  HPB would initially  operate Community Bank as a 

separate bank and then merge Community  Bank with and into HPB’s subsidiary  state 

nonmember  bank, High Plains  Bank, Okeene, Oklahoma.4 

Notice of the proposal,  affording interested persons an opportunity to 

submit comments,  has been published (90 Federal Register  42011 (August 28, 2025)),  in 

accordance with the Board’s Rules of Procedure.5  The time for submitting  comments  has

3  12 U.S.C. § 1842. 
4  The merger  of Community Bank into High Plains  Bank, which is expected to occur 
approximately  six months after HPB’s acquisition  of Community  Bank, would be subject 
to the approval  of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (“FDIC”), under section 
18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  12 U.S.C. § 1828(c).

expired, and the Board did not receive any comments.   The  Board has considered the 

proposal  in light of the factors set forth in section 3 of the BHC Act. 

HPB, with consolidated assets of approximately  $203.8 million,  is the 

2,892nd largest insured depository organization  in the United States.6  HPB controls 

approximately  $178.5 million  in consolidated deposits, which represent less  than 

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

States.7  HPB controls High Plains  Bank, which operates in Oklahoma.   High Plains 

Bank is the 117th largest  insured depository institution in Oklahoma,  controlling  deposits 

of approximately  $150.3 million,  which represent  less than 1 percent of the total deposits 

of insured depository institutions in that state.8 

Community  Bank, with total assets of approximately  $123.1 million,  is the 

3,590th largest  insured depository organization  in the United States.  Community Bank 

controls approximately  $113.2 in consolidated deposits, which represent  less than 

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

States.  Community  Bank operates in Oklahoma.   Community  Bank is the 133rd largest 

insured depository institution in Oklahoma,  controlling  deposits of approximately 

$112.6 million,  which represent less  than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of 

insured depository institutions in that state.  

On consummation  of this proposal,  HPB would become the 2,273rd largest 

insured depository organization  in the United States, with consolidated assets of 

approximately  $326.9 million,  which would represent less than 1 percent of the total 

assets of insured depository organizations  in the United States.  HPB would control total 

consolidated deposits of approximately  $291.7 million,  which would represent less than 

1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United 

6  Consolidated asset and national ranking data are as of June 30, 2025.   
7  Consolidated national deposit and market share data are as of June 30, 2025.  In this 
context, insured depository institutions include commercial  banks,  savings associations, 
and savings banks.

States.  In Oklahoma, HPB would become the 88th largest  insured depository 

organization,  controlling  deposits of approximately  $262.9 million,  which would 

represent  less than 1 percent of the total deposits of insured depository institutions in that 

state.9  

Competitive  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act prohibits the Board from approving  a proposal 

that would result in a monopoly  or would be in furtherance of an attempt to monopolize 

the business  of banking in any relevant  market.10  The BHC Act also prohibits  the Board 

from approving  a proposal  that would substantially lessen  competition  or tend to create a 

monopoly  in any banking  market, unless  the anticompetitive  effects of the proposal are 

clearly  outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the proposal in meeting 

the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.11 

HPB and Community Bank compete directly in the Woods County, 

Oklahoma,  banking market (“Woods County market”).12   The Board has considered the 

competitive  effects of the proposal in this banking market.   In particular,  the Board has 

considered the relative  share of total deposits in insured depository institutions in the 

market (“market  deposits”) that HPB would control;13 the concentration level  of market 

9  The proposal  does not require  interstate analysis  under section 3(d) of the BHC Act 
because the home  state of HPB is Oklahoma, and Community  Bank is located only 
within Oklahoma.  See 12 U.S.C. §§ 1841(o)(4)–(7)  and 1842(d). 

10  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(A). 
11  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(B). 
12  The Woods County market is defined as Woods County, Oklahoma. 
13  Local deposit and market share data are as of June 30, 2024, and are based on 
calculations  in which the deposits of thrift institutions are included at 50 percent.  The 
Board previously  has indicated that thrift institutions have become, or have the potential 
to become, significant  competitors  to commercial  banks.  See, e.g., Midwest Financial 
Group, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin  386 (1989);  National City Corporation,  70 Federal 
Reserve Bulletin  743 (1984).   Thus, the Board regularly  has included thrift deposits in 
market share  calculations  on a 50 percent weighted basis. See, e.g., First Hawaiian,  Inc.,

deposits and the increase  in this level,  as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman  Index 

(“HHI”) under the 1995 Bank Merger  Competitive Review guidelines  (“1995 Bank 

Merger  Guidelines”);14  the number  of competitors that would remain in the market;  and 

other characteristics  of the market.  

The structural  effects that consummation of the proposal  would have in the 

Woods County market warrant a detailed review because the concentration  levels  on 

consummation  would exceed the threshold in the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines  and 

Board precedent when using  initial merger  screening  data. 

HPB is the fifth largest depository organization  in the Woods County 

market, controlling  approximately  $62.4 million  in deposits, which represent 

approximately  8.4 percent of market deposits.  Community  Bank is the third largest 

depository institution in the market, controlling  approximately  $112.6 million  in deposits, 

which represent approximately  15.1 percent of market deposits.  On consummation  of the 

proposal,  HPB would become the second largest  depository organization  in the Woods 

County market, controlling  approximately  $175.0 million  in deposits, which would

market. 
14  Department of Justice, Bank Merger  Competitive Review – Introduction and 
Overview, https://www.justice.gov/atr/bank-merger-competitive-review-introduction-
and-overview-1995  (1995).   On September 17, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice 
(“DOJ”) announced its withdrawal from the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines and 
emphasized  that the 2023 Merger  Guidelines, issued on December  18, 2023, remain  its 
sole and authoritative statement across  all industries.   Press Release,  Department of 
Justice, “Justice  Department Withdraws from 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines,” 
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justicedepartment-withdraws-1995-bank-merger-
guidelines.   The 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines  had been adopted together with the 
federal banking  agencies,  and none of the federal banking agencies  have withdrawn from 
the 1995 Bank Merger  Guidelines.  The  Board continues to apply the 1995 Bank Merger 
Guidelines in evaluating  bank merger  proposals.   The Board traditionally  has considered 
a market unconcentrated if the post-merger  HHI is under 1000, moderately concentrated 
if the post-merger  HHI is between 1000 and 1800, and highly concentrated if the post-
merger  HHI exceeds 1800.  See, e.g., Chemical  Banking Corporation, 78 Federal Reserve 
Bulletin 74 (1992).

represent  approximately  23.4 percent of market deposits.  The HHI in this market would 

increase  253 points to a level of 2663. 

The Board has considered whether factors either mitigate the competitive 

effects of the proposal or indicate that the proposal would not have a significantly  adverse 

effect on competition in the Woods County market.15  Factors indicate that the increase  in 

concentration in the Woods County market, as measured by the HHI and market share, 

overstates the potential competitive  effects of the proposal in the market.   

In conducting its competitive  analysis  in previous  cases,  the Board 

generally  has not adjusted its market share calculations  to exclude categories  of deposits 

because all  deposits are typically  available  to support lending and other banking activities 

at any location,  and the deposits maintained in a specific market  represent a firm’s  ability 

to compete in that market.  However, the Board occasionally  has adjusted its market 

share calculations  to exclude specific  types of deposits when evidence supports a finding 

that those deposits are subject to legal or other restrictions  that constrain an 

organization’s  ability  to use those deposits to support its general  banking activities.16  In 

this case, both HPB and Community Bank service  municipal  deposit accounts, which are 

often subject to legal or other restrictions  on the organization’s  ability  to lend on such 

deposits.  After making  adjustments to account for these deposits, although the Woods 

County market would remain  highly  concentrated, the transaction would increase  the 

HHI in the market by a smaller  amount.   

Further, analysis  of small  business  loan originations  data suggests that the 

transaction would be unlikely  to have a substantial  adverse competitive  impact on small 

15  The number  and strength of factors necessary  to mitigate the competitive  effects of a 
proposal  depend on the size of the increase in, and resulting  level of, concentration in a 
banking market.   See Magnolia  Banking Corporation, FRB Order No. 2019-15    
(October 11, 2019);  see also  NationsBank Corporation, 84 Federal Reserve  Bulletin 129 
(1998). 
16  See First Citizens BancShares,  Inc., FRB Order No. 2019-17, 11–13 (December  16,

business  lending in the market.  Moreover,  although consummation  of this proposal 

would eliminate  one existing competitor,  the Woods County market would continue to be 

served by four other depository organizations,  two of which would have a market share 

of more than 20 percent of market deposits.  The presence  of multiple  competitors 

suggests that HPB would have limited ability to offer less attractive terms to consumers 

unilaterally  and that these competitors would be able to exert competitive pressure  on 

HPB in the Woods County market.   

The DOJ conducted a review of the potential competitive  effects of the 

proposal  and has advised the Board that it did not conclude that the proposal would have 

a significantly  adverse effect on competition.  In addition, the appropriate banking 

agencies  have been afforded an opportunity to comment and have not objected to the 

proposal. 

Based on all the facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation  of 

the proposal  would not have a significantly  adverse effect on competition or on the 

concentration of resources  in any relevant banking  market.  Accordingly, the Board 

determines that competitive  considerations are consistent with approval. 

Financial,  Managerial,  and Other Supervisory  Considerations 

In reviewing  proposals  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the financial  and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the 

institutions involved, the effectiveness of the institutions in combatting money 

laundering,  and any public comments  on the proposal.17  In its evaluation  of financial 

factors, the Board reviews  information regarding  the financial  condition of the 

organizations  involved on both parent-only  and consolidated bases, as well as 

information  regarding the financial  condition of the subsidiary  depository institutions  and 

the organizations’  significant  nonbanking operations.   In this evaluation,  the Board 

considers a variety of public and supervisory  information regarding  capital adequacy, 

asset quality, liquidity, and earnings  performance,  as well as any public comments  on the 

17  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2),  (5), and (6). 

 
 
- 7 - 

proposal.   The Board evaluates  the financial  condition of the combined organization, 

including its capital position,  asset quality,  liquidity, earnings  prospects, and the impact 

of the proposed funding of the transaction.  The Board also considers  the ability of the 

organization  to absorb the costs of the proposal and to complete the proposed integration 

of the operations of the institutions effectively.  In assessing  financial  factors, the Board 

considers capital  adequacy to be especially  important.   The Board considers the future 

prospects of the organizations  involved in the proposal  in light of their financial  and 

managerial  resources  and the proposed business  plan.  

HPB and High Plains  Bank are well capitalized, and the combined 

organization  would remain  so upon consummation  of the proposal.   The proposed 

transaction is a bank acquisition  that is structured as a cash purchase.18  The  capital, asset 

quality, earnings,  and liquidity of HPB and High Plains Bank are consistent with 

approval,  and HPB and High Plains Bank appear  to have adequate resources  to absorb  the 

related costs of the proposal and to complete the integration  of the institutions’ operations 

as proposed.  In addition, the future prospects of the institutions are considered consistent 

with approval.   

The Board also has considered the managerial  resources  of the 

organizations  involved and of the proposed combined organization.   The Board has 

reviewed the examination  records of HPB, High Plains Bank, and Community Bank, 

including assessments  of their management,  risk-management  systems,  and operations.  

In addition, the Board has considered information  provided by HPB; the Board’s 

supervisory  experiences  and those of other relevant bank supervisory  agencies  with the 

organizations;  and the organizations’  records of compliance  with applicable  banking, 

consumer  protection, and anti-money-laundering  laws. 

18  To effect the transaction, HPB would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares 
of common  stock of Community Bank from Community  Bancshares  of Alva, Inc., Alva, 
Oklahoma,  for cash consideration.  HPB has the financial  resources  to effect the proposed 
transaction. 

 
 
- 8 - 

HPB and High Plains  Bank are each considered to be well managed.  The 

combined organization’s  proposed directors and senior executive officers have 

knowledge of and experience  in the banking and financial services  sectors, and the 

proposed risk-management  program  appears consistent with approval.   

The Board also has considered HPB’s plans for implementing  the proposal.   

HPB has conducted comprehensive  due diligence and is devoting sufficient financial and 

other resources  to address all aspects of the post-acquisition  integration  process for this 

proposal.   In addition, HPB’s management  has the experience  and resources  to operate 

the resulting  organization  in a safe and sound manner.    

Based on all the facts of record, including  HPB’s supervisory  records, 

managerial  and operational  resources,  and plans for operating  the combined organization 

after consummation,  the Board determines that considerations relating  to the financial 

and managerial  resources  and the future prospects of the organizations  involved in the 

proposal,  as well as the records of effectiveness of HPB and Community Bank in 

combatting money-laundering  activities,  are consistent with approval. 

Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

In acting on a proposal  under section 3 of the BHC Act, the Board 

considers the effects of the proposal on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to 

be served.19  In evaluating whether the proposal  satisfies  the convenience  and needs 

statutory factor, the Board considers the impact that the proposal  will or is likely  to have 

on the communities  served by the combined organization.   The  Board reviews a variety 

of information to determine whether the relevant institutions’  records demonstrate a 

history of helping  to meet the needs of their customers  and communities.   The Board also 

reviews  the combined institution’s post-consummation  plans and the expected impact of 

those plans  on the communities  served by the combined institution, including on low- and 

moderate-income  (“LMI”) individuals and communities.   The Board considers whether 

the relevant institutions  are helping to meet the credit needs of the communities  they 

19  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2). 

 
 
- 9 - 

serve and are providing access  to banking products and services  that meet the needs of 

customers  and communities,  including the potential impact of branch closures, 

consolidations,  and relocations  on that access.  In addition, the Board reviews the records 

of the relevant depository institutions under the Community  Reinvestment Act of 1977 

(“CRA”).20  The  Board strongly encourages  insured depository institutions to help meet 

the credit needs of the local communities  in which they operate, consistent with the 

institutions’  safe and sound operation and their obligations  under the CRA.21    

In addition, the Board considers the banks’ overall  compliance  records and 

recent fair lending examinations.   Fair lending laws require  all lending institutions to 

provide applicants  with equal access to credit, regardless  of their race, ethnicity, gender, 

or certain other characteristics.   The  Board also considers assessments  of other relevant 

supervisors,  the supervisory  views of examiners,  other supervisory  information, 

information  provided by the applicant,  and public comments  on the proposal.   The Board 

also may consider the acquiring  institution’s business  model and intended marketing and 

outreach, the combined organization’s  plans  after consummation,  and any other 

information  the Board deems relevant. 

In assessing  the convenience  and needs factor in this case, the Board has 

considered all  the facts of record, including reports of examination  of the CRA 

performance  of High Plains  Bank and Community  Bank, the fair lending and compliance 

records of both banks, the supervisory  views of the FDIC, confidential supervisory 

information,  and information provided by HPB.  

Records of Performance  under the CRA 

In evaluating the CRA performance  of the involved institutions,  the Board 

generally  considers each institution’s most recent CRA evaluation and the supervisory 

views of relevant federal supervisors,  which in this case is the FDIC with respect to both 

20  12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq. 
21  See 12 U.S.C. § 2901(b). 

 
 
- 10 - 

High Plains Bank and Community Bank.22  In addition, the Board considers information 

provided by the applicant. 

The CRA requires  that the appropriate  federal financial  supervisor  for a 

depository institution prepare a written evaluation  of the institution’s record of helping  to 

meet the credit needs of its entire community,  including LMI neighborhoods.23   An 

institution’s  most recent CRA performance  evaluation  is a particularly  important 

consideration  in the applications  process  because it represents  a detailed, on-site 

evaluation  by the institution’s  primary  federal supervisor  of the institution’s overall 

record of lending in its communities. 

In general,  federal financial  supervisors  apply a lending test (“Lending 

Test”)  to evaluate the performance  of small  banks, such as High Plains Bank and 

Community  Bank, in helping  to meet the credit needs of the communities  they serve.24  

The Lending Test specifically  evaluates an institution’s  lending-related  activities to 

determine whether the institution is helping  to meet the credit needs of individuals and 

geographies  of all income  levels.   As part of the Lending Test, examiners  review and 

analyze  an institution’s  data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act of 1975, 

automated loan reports, and other reports generated by the institution, in order to assess 

an institution’s  lending activities  with respect to borrowers and geographies  of different 

income  levels.   The institution’s  lending performance  is evaluated based on the 

institution’s  (1) loan-to-deposit ratio and, as appropriate,  other lending-related activities, 

such as loan originations  for sale  to the secondary markets,  community  development 

loans, or qualified investments;  (2) percentage of loans and, as appropriate,  other lending-

related activities  located in the bank’s assessment  areas  (“AAs”); (3) record of lending to, 

and, as appropriate,  engaging  in other lending-related  activities for, borrowers  of different

income  levels  and businesses  and farms of different sizes; (4) geographic  distribution of 

loans;  and (5) record of taking action, if warranted, in response  to written complaints 

about the institution’s  performance  in helping to meet credit needs in the bank’s AAs.25 

CRA Performance  of High Plains  Bank 

High Plains Bank was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its 

most recent CRA performance  evaluation  by the FDIC, as of October 7, 2024 (“High 

Plains  Bank Evaluation”).26   The bank received a “Satisfactory” rating for the Lending 

Test.27   

Examiners  found that High Plains Bank’s loan-to-deposit  ratio was 

reasonable  given the institution’s size  and financial condition and its AA’s credit needs.  

Examiners  noted that a majority of the bank’s loans  were inside the institution’s  AA.  

Examiners  determined that the geographic distribution of the bank’s loans  reflected 

reasonable  dispersion throughout its AA.  Examiners  found that the distribution of 

borrowers  reflected excellent  penetration among farms and businesses  of different sizes.  

Finally,  examiners  noted that the bank did not receive any CRA-related complaints 

during the evaluation  period. 

CRA Performance  of Community Bank 

Community  Bank was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at its 

most recent CRA performance  evaluation  by the FDIC, as of February 3, 2025 

25  See 12 CFR 228.26(b) (2023). 
26  The High Plains  Bank Evaluation  was conducted  using Small Institution  CRA 
Examination  Procedures.   Examiners  reviewed  small  farm  and small  business  loan data 
from  February 4, 2019, through  October 7, 2024. 
27  The High Plains  Bank Evaluation  involved  a full-scope  review of the bank’s  activities 
in the bank’s sole AA, consisting  of Blaine, Cimarron,  Washita,  and Woods counties  in 
Oklahoma.   Although High Plains  Bank removed  Cimarron  County from  the AA due to 
the sale of certain  branches  in late 2023, the FDIC included  Cimarron  County in its 
evaluation  because it was part of the AA for a majority  of the evaluation  period as well as 
during the year of the data analyzed  and presented.

(“Community  Bank Evaluation”).28  The bank received a “Satisfactory” rating for the 

Lending Test.29  

Examiners  found that Community Bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 

reasonable  given the institution’s size  and financial condition and its AA’s credit needs.  

Examiners  noted that a majority of the bank’s loans  were inside the institution’s  AA.  

Examiners  found that the distribution of borrowers reflected excellent  penetration among 

farms and businesses  of different sizes.  Finally,  examiners  found that the bank did not 

receive  any CRA-related complaints  during the evaluation  period. 

Additional  Supervisory  Views 

In its review of the proposal,  the Board consulted with and considered the 

views of the FDIC as the primary  federal supervisor  of both High Plains Bank and 

Community  Bank.  The  Board also considered the results of the most recent consumer 

compliance  examinations  of High Plains  Bank and Community Bank, which included 

reviews  of the banks’ compliance  management  programs  and their compliance  with 

consumer  protection laws and regulations,  including fair lending.   

The Board has taken this information, as well as the CRA performance 

records of High Plains  Bank and Community Bank, into account in evaluating  the 

proposal,  including  in considering  whether HPB has the experience  and resources  to 

ensure that the combined organization  would help meet the credit needs of the 

communities  to be served following consummation  of the proposed transaction. 

Additional  Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board also considers  other potential effects of the proposal on the 

convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  This  includes, for example,  the 

combined organization’s  business  model and intended marketing and outreach and 

28  The Community  Bank Evaluation  was conducted  using Small Institution  CRA 
Examination  Procedures.   Examiners  reviewed  small  farm and small  business  loan data 
from  February 25, 2019, through  February  3, 2025. 
29  The Community  Bank Evaluation  involved  a full-scope  review of the bank’s activities 
in the bank’s sole AA, consisting  of Woods County, Oklahoma.    

 
 
- 13 - 

existing  and anticipated product and service offerings in the communities  to be served by 

the organization;  any additional plans  the combined organization  has for meeting the 

needs of its communities  following consummation;  and any other information  the Board 

deems relevant.   

HPB represents  that, following consummation  of the transaction, it expects 

Community  Bank’s current programs,  products, activities,  lending, investments,  and 

services  to remain  largely  unchanged.  HPB represents  that High Plains Bank also intends 

to continue with its current programs,  products, activities,  lending, investments,  and 

services.   High Plains  Bank also expects to bring its leadership  and lending expertise  to 

Community  Bank, thereby enabling  Community  Bank to make additional extensions  of 

credit available  to the Woods County banking market.     

Branch Closures 

Physical  branches  remain  important to many banking  organizations’  ability 

to meet the credit needs of the local  communities  in which they operate.  When banking 

organizations  combine,  whether through acquisitions,  mergers,  or consolidations,  the 

combination  has the potential to increase  or to reduce consumers’  and small  businesses’ 

access  to available  credit and other banking services.   Although the Board does not have 

the authority to prohibit a bank from closing  a branch, the Board focuses on the impact of 

expected branch closures,  consolidations,  and relocations  that occur in connection with a 

proposal  on the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served by the resulting 

institution.  In particular,  the Board considers the effect of any closures,  consolidations, 

or relocations  on LMI communities.   

Federal banking law provides a specific  mechanism  for addressing branch 

closings,  including  requiring  that a bank provide notice to the public  and the appropriate 

federal supervisory  agency before a branch is closed.30  In addition, the federal banking 

30  See 12 U.S.C. § 1831r-1.  The bank also is required  to provide  reasons  and other 
supporting  data for the closure,  consistent  with the institution’s  written  policy for branch 
closings. 

 
 
- 14 - 

supervisory  agencies  evaluate a bank’s  record of opening and closing  branches, 

particularly  branches  located in LMI geographies  or that primarily  service  LMI 

individuals, as part of the CRA examination  process,  as applicable.31 

HPB represents  that it would operate High Plains  Bank and Community 

Bank as separate institutions  for approximately  six  months following  consummation  of 

the proposal.   HPB represents  that, following the bank merger,  it expects to consolidate 

an existing  branch with the former main  office of Community Bank in Alva, Oklahoma.   

HPB asserts that customers of the affected office would receive closure  notices consistent 

with the requirements  of applicable  law and that it does not expect the proposed 

transaction to result in any other branch closures. 

The Board has considered all  the facts of record relating to branch closures, 

consolidations,  and relocations,  including the records of the relevant depository 

institutions under the CRA and fair lending laws in relation  to branch closures;  the 

institutions’  policies  and procedures on and records of compliance  with federal banking 

law regarding branch closures;  the views of the FDIC; supervisory  information;  and 

information  provided by HPB.  Based on that review, the Board concludes that HPB has 

established policies,  programs,  and procedures designed to ensure the bank’s  branching 

network is consistent with the bank’s  CRA and fair lending obligations  and to mitigate 

the impact of any branch  closures  on communities  to be served by the combined bank. 

Conclusion  on Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board has considered all  the facts of record, including the records of 

the relevant depository institutions under the CRA, the institutions’ records of 

compliance  with fair lending and other consumer  protection laws, supervisory 

information,  information  provided by HPB, and other potential effects of the proposal on 

the convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  Based on that review, the 

Board determines that the convenience  and needs factor is consistent with approval.    

31  For small  banks evaluated  pursuant  to the Small  Bank Lending Test, this  evaluation  is 
at the option of the bank.  See 12 CFR 228.21(a)(3)  (2023).  

 
 
- 15 - 

Financial  Stability  Considerations 

Section 3 of the BHC Act requires the Board to consider “the extent to 

which a proposed acquisition,  merger,  or consolidation would result in greater or more 

concentrated risks  to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.”32   

To assess  the likely  effect of a proposed transaction on the stability of the 

United States banking or financial  system, the Board considers a variety of metrics that 

capture the systemic  “footprint” of the resulting  firm and the incremental  effect of the 

transaction on the systemic  footprint of the acquiring firm.  These metrics  include 

measures  of the size of the resulting  firm, the availability  of substitute providers for any 

critical  products and services  offered by the resulting firm, the interconnectedness  of the 

resulting  firm with the banking or financial  system, the extent to which the resulting  firm 

contributes to the complexity  of the financial system,  and the extent of the cross-border 

activities  of the resulting firm.33  These  categories  are not exhaustive, and additional 

categories  could inform the Board’s decision.   

In addition to these quantitative measures,  the Board considers  qualitative 

factors, such as the opacity and complexity of an institution’s  internal  organization,  that 

are indicative of the relative degree of difficulty of resolving the resulting  firm.  A 

financial  institution that can be resolved in an orderly manner is less  likely  to inflict 

material  damage on the broader economy.34 

The Board’s experience  has shown that proposals  involving  an acquisition 

of less than $10 billion  in total assets, or that result in a firm with less than $100 billion  in 

total assets, generally  are not likely  to pose systemic  risks.   Accordingly, the Board 

presumes  that a proposal  does not raise  material  financial  stability concerns  if the assets 

involved fall below either of these size thresholds, absent evidence that the transaction 

32  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(7). 
33  Many of the metrics  considered  by the Board measure  an institution’s  activities 
relative  to the United  States  financial  system. 
34  For further  discussion  of the financial  stability  standard,  see Capital  One Financial 
Corporation,  FRB Order No. 2012-2 (February  14, 2012). 

 
 
- 16 - 

would result in a significant increase  in interconnectedness,  complexity,  cross-border 

activities,  or other risk factors.35 

In this case, the Board has considered information  relevant to risks  to the 

stability of the United States banking or financial  system.  The  proposal  involves  a target 

with less than $10 billion  in total assets and a pro forma organization  with less than 

$100 billion  in total assets.  Both the acquirer  and the target are predominantly  engaged 

in retail and commercial  banking  activities.36  The  pro forma organization  would not 

exhibit an organizational  structure, complex  interrelationships,  or unique characteristics 

that would complicate resolution  of the firm in the event of financial distress.  In 

addition, the organization  would not be a critical  services  provider or so interconnected 

with other firms  or the markets  that it would pose a significant  risk to the financial  system 

in the event of financial distress.  

In light of all the facts and circumstances,  this transaction  would not appear 

to result in meaningfully  greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United 

States banking or financial  system.  Based on these and all other facts of record, the 

Board determines that considerations relating  to financial  stability are consistent with 

approval.   

Conclusion 

Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board determines 

that the proposal should be, and hereby is, approved.  In reaching its conclusion,  the 

Board has considered all the facts of record in light of the factors that it is required to 

consider under the BHC Act and other applicable  statutes.  The Board’s approval  is 

35  See People’s  United Financial,  Inc., FRB Order No. 2017-08  at 25–26 
(March  16, 2017).  Notwithstanding  this presumption,  the Board has the authority  to 
review the financial  stability  implications  of any proposal.   For example,  an acquisition 
involving  a global systemically  important  bank could warrant a financial  stability  review 
by the Board, regardless  of the size of the acquisition.   
36  HPB and Community  Bank offer  a range of retail  and commercial  banking  products 
and services.   HPB has, and as a result  of the proposal  would continue  to have, a small 
market  share  in these  products  and services  on a nationwide  basis. 

 
 
- 17 - 

specifically  conditioned on compliance  by HPB with all the conditions imposed in this 

order and on any commitments  made to the Board in connection with the proposal.   The 

Board’s approval also  is conditioned on receipt by HPB of all required regulatory 

approvals.   For purposes  of this action, the conditions and commitments  are deemed to be 

conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection  with its findings and decision 

herein  and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable  law. 

The proposal  may not be consummated before the 15th calendar day after 

the effective date of this order or later than three months thereafter, unless such period is 

extended for good cause by the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, acting 

under delegated authority. 

By order of the Board of Governors,37 effective October 16, 2025.

FRB Order No. 2025-18 
October 31, 2025 

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

First Security Bank 
Searcy, Arkansas 

Order Approving the Establishment  of a Branch 

First Security Bank (“FSB”),  a wholly owned state member  bank subsidiary 

of First Security  Bancorp (“Bancorp”),  both of Searcy, Arkansas,  has requested the 

Board’s approval under section  9 of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”)1 and the Board’s 

Regulation H 2 to establish a branch at 4007 North Rodney Parham  Road, Little Rock, 

Arkansas.    

Notice of the proposal,  affording interested persons an opportunity to 

submit comments,  has been published in accordance with the Board’s Rules of 

Procedure.3  The time for submitting comments  has expired, and the Board received two 

comments  on the proposal.   The  Board has considered the proposal and the comments 

received in light of the factors specified in the FRA. 

Bancorp, with total consolidated assets of approximately  $8.4 billion,  is the 

171st largest  depository organization  in the United States, controlling  approximately 

$6.5 billion  in deposits, which represent less  than 1 percent of the total amount of 

1  12 U.S.C. § 321.  Under section 9 of the FRA, state member banks may establish  and 
operate branches  on the same terms  and conditions as are applicable  to the establishment 
of branches by national banks.  A national bank may establish  and operate a de novo 
branch within a state in which the bank is situated if such establishment  and operation is 
authorized under applicable  state law.  See 12 U.S.C. § 36(c)(2).   FSB has branches  in 
Arkansas  and is permitted to establish  additional branches  under the laws of 
Arkansas.   See Ark. Code. § 23-48-702(b)(1)(A).

3  12 CFR 262.3(b).

deposits of insured depository institutions  in the United States.4  FSB operates branches 

in Arkansas and Florida, and the bank’s main office is in Searcy, Arkansas.5   

Under section 208.6 of the Board’s Regulation  H,6 which implements 

section 9 of the FRA, the factors that the Board must consider in acting on a branch 

application  include (1) the financial  history and condition of the applying  bank and the 

general  character of its management;  (2) the adequacy of the bank’s capital  and the 

bank’s future earnings  prospects;  (3) the convenience  and needs of the community to be 

served by the branch; (4) in the case of branches  with deposit-taking capability,  the 

bank’s performance  under the Community Reinvestment  Act (“CRA”);7 and (5) whether 

the bank’s investment  in bank premises  in establishing  the branch satisfies  certain 

criteria.8   The Board has considered the branch application  in light of these factors and 

the public  comments received  on the proposal.    

Financial,  Managerial,  and Other Supervisory  Considerations 

In considering the financial  history and condition, earnings  prospects, and 

capital adequacy of FSB, the Board has reviewed reports  of examination,  other 

supervisory  information,  publicly  reported and other financial  information,  information 

provided by FSB, and the comments received  on the proposal.   FSB is well capitalized 

and would remain so upon consummation  of the proposal.   The Board has considered 

FSB’s asset quality,  earnings  (including  future earnings  prospects), and liquidity, and 

FSB has adequate resources  to absorb the costs of the proposal.   The Board also has 

4  Total assets data are as of June 30, 2025.  National deposit data are as of June 30, 2025, 
and national ranking  and state deposit data are as of June 30, 2024.  In this context, 
insured depository institutions include commercial  banks, savings and loan associations, 
and savings banks.  
5  In Arkansas, FSB is the 4th largest depository organization,  controlling  approximately 
$6.2 billion  in deposits, which represent 6.1 percent of the total amount of deposits of 
insured depository institutions in that state.

reviewed FSB’s proposed investment in the branch and concludes that the bank’s 

investment is consistent with regulatory  limitations  on investment in bank premises.9    

In considering FSB’s managerial  resources,  the Board has reviewed the 

bank’s examination  record, including  assessments  of its management,  risk-management 

systems,  and operations.  The Board also has considered its supervisory  experiences  with 

FSB and the bank’s record of compliance  with applicable  banking, consumer  protection, 

and anti-money-laundering  laws.  FSB’s directors and senior executive  officers have 

substantial  knowledge of and experience in the banking  and financial services  sectors.    

Based on this review and all the facts of record, the Board determines that 

FSB’s management,  financial  history and condition, capital adequacy, compliance  with 

applicable  banking and consumer  protection laws, and future earnings  prospects, as well 

as the effectiveness of FSB in combatting money-laundering  activities,  are consistent 

with approval  of the proposal. 

Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

In acting on a branching  proposal  under section 9 of the FRA and the 

Board’s Regulation H, the Board considers the effects of the proposal on the convenience 

and needs of the communities  to be served.10  In evaluating  whether the proposal  satisfies 

the convenience  and needs statutory factor, the Board considers the impact that the 

proposal  will or is likely  to have on the communities  served by the bank.  

The Board reviews  a variety of information  to determine whether the 

bank’s record demonstrates a history of helping  to meet the needs of its customers  and 

communities.   The Board also reviews  the bank’s plans  regarding the proposed branch 

and the expected impact of those plans on the communities  served by the bank, including 

9  Pursuant to section 24A of the FRA, 12 U.S.C. § 371d, upon consummation  of the 
proposed transaction, FSB’s investment in bank premises  would remain  within the legal 
requirements  of 12 CFR 208.21.  Having considered all the relevant statutory factors, the 
Board does not object to the proposed investment  in the branch.   
10  12 U.S.C. § 321; 12 CFR 208.6(b)(3).   Where  applicable,  the Board also considers  any 
timely  substantive comments  on the proposal  and, in its discretion, may consider any 
untimely  substantive comments  on the proposal. 

 
 
 
- 4 - 

on low- and moderate-income  (“LMI”)  individuals and communities.   The  Board 

considers whether the bank is helping  to meet the credit needs of the communities  it 

serves  and is providing access  to banking products and services  that meet the needs of 

customers  and communities,  including the potential impact of the proposed branch  and 

any related closures,  consolidations,  and relocations  on that access.  In addition, the 

Board reviews the bank’s  record under the CRA.  The Board strongly encourages  insured 

depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local  communities  in which 

they operate, consistent with the institutions’  safe and sound operation and their 

obligations  under the CRA.11 

In addition, the Board considers the bank’s overall  compliance  record and 

recent fair lending examinations.   Fair lending laws require  all lending institutions to 

provide loan applicants  with equal access to credit, regardless  of their race, ethnicity, 

gender, or certain other characteristics.   The Board also considers  assessments  of other 

relevant supervisors,  the supervisory  views of examiners,  other supervisory  information, 

information  provided by the applicant,  and public comments  received on the proposal.   

The Board also may consider the institution’s  business  model, its intended marketing and 

outreach, its plans  for the proposed branch,  and any other information  the Board deems 

relevant. 

In assessing  the convenience  and needs factor in this case, the Board has 

considered all  the facts of record, including reports of examination  of the CRA 

performance  of FSB, the fair lending and compliance  records of the bank, the supervisory 

views of the Federal Reserve  Bank of St. Louis (“Reserve  Bank”), confidential 

supervisory  information,  information  provided by FSB, and the public comments 

received on the proposal.    

Public Comments on the Proposal 

The Board received two adverse comments  on the proposal,  both from the 

same commenter.   The commenter  objected to the proposal,  alleging  that, based on data 

11  See 12 U.S.C. § 2901(b). 

 
 
 
- 5 - 

reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act of 1975 (“HMDA”),12 FSB made 

fewer home loans  to African Americans  as compared to white individuals in Arkansas  in 

2024.  The commenter  also alleged that FSB denied home loan applications  of African 

American  individuals at a higher  rate than those of white individuals in Arkansas.  The 

commenter  asked the Board to consider that the most recent CRA performance  evaluation 

of FSB, as of January 23, 2023 (“FSB Evaluation”),  does not take into account the 2024 

HMDA data.   

In general,  the Board and the other federal financial supervisors  apply a 

lending test (“Lending Test”),  an investment  test (“Investment Test”),  and a service  test 

(“Service  Test”)  to evaluate the performance  of large banks, such as FSB, in helping  to 

meet the credit needs of the communities  they serve.   The commenter  stated that the FSB 

Evaluation indicated that, (1) for the Lending Test, FSB’s geographic  distribution of 

loans in the Arkansas  Nonmetropolitan  Statewide Area (“non-MSA Arkansas”)  reflected 

“poor” penetration throughout this assessment  area (“AA”); (2) for the Investment Test, 

FSB’s performance  in its three limited-scope-review  AAs—the Jonesboro,  Arkansas 

(“Jonesboro”)  Metropolitan  Statistical Area (“MSA”), the Hot Springs,  Arkansas (“Hot 

Springs”)  MSA, and the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma  (“Fort Smith”) MSA—was 

below its overall  institution Investment Test performance  in the full-scope-review  AAs; 

and, (3) for the Service Test, the accessibility  of delivery systems in two of the limited-

scope-review  AAs, the Jonesboro MSA and the Hot Springs MSA, was below the overall 

accessibility  of FSB’s delivery systems  in its full-scope  review AAs, and that the 

community  development services  FSB provided in the Jonesboro  MSA were also below 

its overall  level of providing community  development services  in its full-scope-review 

AAs. 13 

12  12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq. 
13  The FSB Evaluation  included a full-scope  review of the following areas:   the Little 
Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, Arkansas MSA; Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, 
Arkansas  MSA; and the non-MSA Arkansas AA.  The FSB Evaluation  included a

Business  of the Applicant  and Response  to Comments 

Through  its network of branches, FSB offers a variety  of consumer and 

commercial  products and services,  including business  and consumer  accounts, small 

business  and mortgage loans,  debit and credit cards, bill-pay  services,  wire transfers, and 

lockbox services.   FSB’s commercial  lending services  include real estate, construction, 

commercial,  and equipment financing.  FSB also offers Small  Business  Administration 

loans.  FSB’s deposit products for commercial  and retail banking markets  include 

checking,  interest-bearing  and business money  market checking,  business  sweep, savings, 

time deposit, and retirement accounts, as well as mobile  banking services,  including 

mobile  deposit, and internet banking  services  with bill-pay  options.  

In response  to the comments, FSB argues  that the commenter provided a 

limited analysis  of FSB’s HMDA data in Arkansas.  FSB notes that it received an overall 

rating of “Satisfactory” for the FSB Evaluation, a “High Satisfactory” rating in the 

Lending and Service  Tests, and an “Outstanding” rating in the Investment Test.  FSB 

represents  that the FSB Evaluation found that its lending levels reflected good 

responsiveness  to the credit needs of its AAs and good penetration among customers  of 

different income levels  and business  and farms of different sizes.  FSB further represents 

that the FSB Evaluation found that it also makes a relatively  high level of community 

development loans and makes an excellent  level of community  development investments 

and grants.  FSB represents  that it has a satisfactory record of meeting the credit needs of 

its entire community,  including LMI areas.  In addition, FSB represents that it regularly 

updates its fair lending compliance  policies  and procedures to reflect changes  in law or 

guidance and that it conducts fair lending training.    

FSB also states that it has a system to deliver marketing  and outreach to 

individuals in its AAs, including  development of a strategic media plan.  Further, FSB 

limited-scope  review of the Fort Smith MSA, the Hot Springs MSA, and the Jonesboro 
MSA.

represents  that it has established programs  to address unbanked and underbanked 

consumers,  provide financial  education, and increase rates in homeownership. 

Record of Performance  Under the CRA 

In evaluating the CRA performance  of the involved institution, the Board 

generally  considers the institution’s  most recent CRA performance  evaluation, as well as 

other information  and supervisory  views of the relevant federal supervisor,  which in this 

case is the Reserve Bank.14  In addition, the Board considers information  provided by the 

applicant  and by any public  commenters. 

The CRA requires  that the appropriate  federal financial  supervisor  for a 

depository institution prepare a written evaluation  of the institution’s record of helping  to 

meet the credit needs of its entire community,  including LMI neighborhoods.15   An 

institution’s  most recent CRA performance  evaluation  is a particularly  important 

consideration  in the applications  process  because it represents  a detailed, on-site 

evaluation  by the institution’s  primary  federal supervisor  of the institution’s overall 

record of lending in its communities. 

As noted above, the Board and the other federal financial  supervisors 

generally  apply a Lending Test, an Investment Test, and a Service  Test to evaluate the 

performance  of large banks, such as FSB, in helping to meet the credit needs of the 

communities  they serve.  The Lending Test specifically  evaluates  an institution’s  lending-

related activities  to determine whether the institution is helping  to meet the credit needs of 

individuals and geographies  of all income  levels.   As part of the Lending Test, examiners 

review and analyze an institution’s  data reported under the HMDA, in addition to small 

business,  small  farm, and community  development loan data collected and reported under

evaluated based on a variety of factors, including  (1) the number and amounts of home 

mortgage, small  business,  small  farm, and consumer  loans (as applicable)  in the 

institution’s  CRA AAs; (2) the geographic  distribution of the institution’s lending, 

including the proportion  and dispersion of the institution’s  lending in its AAs and the 

number  and amounts of loans in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  geographies; 

(3) the distribution of loans based on borrower  characteristics,  including, for home 

mortgage loans,  the number and amounts of loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-

income  individuals;16 (4) the institution’s  community  development lending, including the 

number  and amounts of community  development loans and their complexity  and 

innovativeness;  and (5) the institution’s use of innovative or flexible  lending practices  to 

address the credit needs of LMI individuals and geographies.17  The  Investment Test 

evaluates  the number and amounts of qualified investments  that benefit the institution’s 

AAs.  The Service  Test evaluates  the availability  and effectiveness of the institution’s 

systems  for delivering retail  banking services  and the extent and innovativeness of the 

institution’s  community  development services.18 

CRA Performance  of FSB 

FSB was assigned an overall  rating of “Satisfactory” at the most recent FSB 

Evaluation.19  FSB received an “Outstanding” rating for the Investment Test, and a “High 

Satisfactory” rating for the Lending and Service Tests. 

16  Examiners  also consider the number  and amounts of small  business  and small  farm 
loans made to businesses  and farms with gross annual revenues  of $1 million  or less; 
small  business  and small  farm loans by loan amount at origination;  and consumer  loans, 
if applicable,  to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income  individuals.  See, e.g., 
12 CFR 228.22(b)(3)  (2023). 
17  See 12 CFR 228.22(b) (2023). 
18  See 12 CFR 228.23 and 228.24 (2023).  
19  The FSB Evaluation  was conducted using Interagency Large Bank CRA Examination 
Procedures.  Examiners  reviewed HMDA-reportable,  small  business,  and small  farm 
loans from January  1, 2020, through December  31, 2021.  Examiners  also reviewed 
community  development loans,  investments, and service  activities  from August 17, 2020, 
through January 22, 2023. 

 
 
 
- 9 - 

With respect to the Lending Test, examiners  determined that FSB’s lending 

activity reflected good responsiveness  to the credit needs of the bank’s AAs and that the 

bank’s geographic  distribution of loans reflected adequate penetration throughout its 

AAs.  Examiners  found that a substantial majority  of the bank’s loans were made within 

the bank’s AAs.  Examiners  also found that the distribution of loans by borrower’s 

income  and revenue profile reflected good penetration among customers  of different 

income  levels  and businesses  and farms of different sizes.  Examiners  noted that the bank 

made a relatively  high level  of community development loans.   In the non-MSA 

Arkansas  AA, an area of interest to the commenter,  examiners  found that, although the 

bank’s overall  geographic  distribution of loans reflected poor penetration throughout this 

AA, the bank’s distribution of loans based on borrower’s  income or revenue  profile 

reflected good penetration among customers  of different income levels  and businesses 

and farms of different sizes in the AA.  In addition, examiners determined that FSB made 

an adequate level  of community  development loans in the non-MSA Arkansas AA.    

With respect to the Investment Test, examiners  found that FSB made an 

excellent  level of community  development investments  and grants throughout its AAs 

and is often in a leadership  position.  Examiners  found that FSB’s investments and grants 

occasionally  were innovative  and complex and demonstrated good responsiveness  to 

credit and community  development needs.  As noted by the commenter,  although FSB’s 

Investment Test performance  in its three limited-scope-review  AAs was below its overall 

Investment Test performance  in its full-scope  review AAs, FSB received an 

“Outstanding” rating overall  for the Investment Test.  

With respect to the Service Test, examiners  found that the bank’s service 

delivery systems  were accessible  to the bank’s geographies  and to individuals of different 

income  levels  across  its AAs and that the bank’s services  do not vary in a way that 

inconveniences  the needs of its AAs, particularly  in LMI geographies.   Examiners  noted 

that the bank provides an adequate level  of community  development services  and that the 

bank’s changes  in branch  locations had not adversely affected the accessibility  of its 

service  delivery systems.   Examiners  also found that the bank’s record of opening and 

 
 
- 10 - 

closing  of branches had not adversely affected the accessibility  of its delivery systems, 

particularly  in LMI geographies  or to LMI individuals.  In the Jonesboro MSA and Hot 

Springs  MSA AAs, two limited-scope-review  AAs of interest to the commenter,  although 

examiners  found that the accessibility  of FSB’s delivery systems  in these two AAs and 

FSB’s provision  of community  development services  in the Jonesboro  MSA AA were 

below the overall  levels  in its full-scope-review  AAs, examiners  also  found that the 

bank’s Service  Test performance  in both of those AAs was consistent with the 

institution’s  overall  Service  Test performance,  which was rated “High Satisfactory.”  

Examiners  also found that the reasonableness  of FSB’s business  hours and services  in the 

Jonesboro  MSA and Hot Springs MSA limited-scope-review  AAs was consistent with 

the institution’s  overall  Service  Test performance  in its full-scope-review  AAs.  

Additional  Supervisory  Considerations 

In addition to the FSB Evaluation, the Board has considered the most recent 

consumer  compliance  examination  and fair lending record of FSB and consulted with the 

Reserve Bank regarding the bank’s CRA, consumer  compliance,  and fair lending records.   

Additional  Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board also considers  other potential effects of the proposal on the 

convenience  and needs of the communities  to be served.  FSB represents  that the 

community,  both businesses  and consumers,  in the region of the proposed branch  would 

benefit from having another branch in the market. 

Conclusion  on Convenience  and Needs Considerations 

The Board has considered all  the facts of record, including the CRA record 

of FSB, the bank’s record of compliance  with fair lending and other consumer  protection 

laws, confidential supervisory  information,  information  provided by FSB, the public 

comments  on the proposal,  and other potential effects of the proposal on the convenience 

 
 
- 11 - 

and needs of the communities  to be served.  Based on that review, the Board determines 

that the convenience  and needs considerations are consistent with approval.    

Conclusion 

Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board determines 

that the application  should be, and hereby is, approved.20  The Board’s approval  is 

specifically  conditioned on compliance  by FSB with all  the conditions imposed in this 

order, including  receipt of all required regulatory  approvals,  and on any commitments 

made to the Board in connection  with this proposal.   For purposes  of this action, the 

conditions and commitments  are deemed to be conditions imposed in writing by the 

Board in connection  with its findings and decision herein  and, as such, may be enforced 

in proceedings under applicable  law.   

Approval of this application  is also subject to the establishment  of the  

20  The commenter  requested that the Board hold a public hearing  on the proposal.   Under 
its rules,  the Board, in its discretion, may hold a public  hearing  if appropriate  to allow 
interested persons  an opportunity to provide relevant testimony when written comments 
would not adequately present their views.  The Board has considered the commenter’s 
request in light of all the facts of record.  In the Board’s view, the commenter  has had 
ample  opportunity to submit comments  on the proposal  and, in fact, submitted two 
written comments  that the Board has considered in acting on the proposal.   The 
commenter’s  request does not identify disputed issues of fact that are material  to the 
Board’s decision and would be clarified by a public  hearing.   In addition, the request does 
not demonstrate why the written comments  do not present the commenter’s  views 
adequately or why a hearing  otherwise would be necessary  or appropriate.   For these 
reasons,  and based on all the facts of record, the Board has determined that a public 
hearing  is not required or warranted in this case.  Accordingly, the request for public 
hearings  on the proposal  is denied.

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced expanded operating days of two large-value payments services, Fedwire ® Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to include Sundays and weekday holidays. The Reserve Banks will implement this expansion in several years, no earlier than 2028 to ensure operational and industry readiness.

Currently, both the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operate Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Once the expansion announced today is implemented, the Reserve Banks will operate both services Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays. The operating hours each day will remain the same, with the Fedwire Funds Service open 22 hours per day, and NSS open 21.5 hours per day.

Moving forward, the Board will monitor demand for a potential further expansion of operating hours to seven days per week. If the Board decides in the future to propose such an expansion, it will seek public comment in a new proposal.

The Fedwire Funds Service is a wholesale payment service that allows participating banks and credit unions to send and receive individual electronic funds transfers up to $10 billion. NSS is a settlement service for participants in private-sector clearing arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector automated clearinghouse network, and securities settlement systems. The announcement does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the Federal Reserve's retail services including FedACH or FedNow ® Service.

Docket No. OP – 1870 

Federal Reserve Action to Expand Fedwire® Funds Service and National Settlement 

Service Operating Hours  

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

ACTION: Service Announcement. 

SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is announcing 

that the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) will expand the operating hours for the 

Fedwire® Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 6 days per week, operating Sunday through Friday, 

including weekday holidays (22x6).1 The Board is also announcing a corresponding expansion 

of the National Settlement Service’s (NSS) operating hours to 21.5 hours per day, 6 days per 

week, operating Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays, with NSS closing 30 

minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. The Board expects the Reserve Banks to 

implement this expansion in 2028 or 2029 to ensure technological, operational, and industry 

readiness. The decision to expand operating hours is intended to support a wide range of 

payment activities, as well as the U.S. dollar’s key role in global commerce and the international 

financial system. Further, the planned expansion to 22x6 operating hours will serve as an interim 

step and provide the necessary foundational capability for the Reserve Banks to expand 

operating hours up to 22x7x365 in the future. The Board will monitor industry demand and will 

stand ready to offer an additional expansion up to 22x7x365 no sooner than two years after the 

1 “Fedwire” is a service mark of the Federal Reserve Banks. References to “22x6” herein also refer to the 
corresponding expansion of NSS, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

Page 1 of 45 

 
 
Reserve Banks implement 22x6 operations. If the Board does propose to expand operating hours 

beyond 22x6, it will seek public comment in a separate proposal.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve is exploring whether to expand discount window 

operating days in connection with the expansion of the Fedwire Funds Service. As part of this 

exploration, the Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional outreach to stakeholders to ensure it 

fully understands the benefits and costs of expanded discount window operations for institutions 

of various sizes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction 

This notice is organized into five sections. Section I contains background information on 

the Federal Reserve’s role in the payment system, a summary of the 2024 Federal Register notice 

proposing to expand Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours to 22x7x365 (the 2024 

Notice), and a summary of comments received in response to the 2024 Notice. 2 Section II 

2 89 FR 39613 (May 9, 2024). The Fedwire Funds Service is currently open from 9:00 p.m. eastern time (ET) of the 
preceding calendar day to 7:00 p.m. ET, five days per week, Monday through Friday excluding holidays observed 
by the Reserve Banks. NSS is open from 9:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET, five days per week, Monday through Friday 
excluding holidays observed by the Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve has historically provided at least 30 
minutes between the close of NSS and the close of the Fedwire Funds Service, recognizing that the Fedwire Funds 
Service is the primary alternative for orderly and efficient settlement of bilateral obligations in case a settlement 
arrangement is unable to complete its multilateral settlement through NSS.

discusses the planned actions, which take into consideration comments submitted in response to 

the 2024 Notice. Section III assesses the planned expansion’s compliance with the requirements 

of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (MCA) and the Board’s criteria for new services and major 

service enhancements. Section IV contains high-level implementation details and considerations 

for expanding Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours. Section V is a competitive 

impact analysis of the expansion of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours to 22x6.  

A.  Background 

The Federal Reserve has a long-standing policy objective to foster a safe and efficient 

U.S. payment system. The Federal Reserve advances its objectives for the payment system in 

part through the Reserve Banks’ operation of two large-value payment services: the Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS. 3 The Fedwire Funds Service is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) 

service that allows participants to send and receive individual funds transfers up to one penny 

less than $10 billion in value. Settlement of payments over the Fedwire Funds Service is 

immediate, final, and irrevocable. NSS is a multilateral settlement service that allows for 

immediate, final, and irrevocable settlement of obligations that arise from private-sector clearing 

arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector automated clearinghouse (ACH) 

network, and securities settlement systems. 4 Together, these services, alongside a large-value 

payment service operated by the private sector, provide the backbone for the nation’s payment 

system and support a significant amount of economic activity in the United States, including 

3 The Fedwire Funds Service supports large-value payments (frequently referred to as “wholesale” payments). The 
majority of the value is sent via bank-to-bank transfers, while the majority of the volume is sent via  third-party or 
“customer” transfers, which are sent by Fedwire participants on behalf of their customers (for example, 
corporations, consumers, and nonbank financial institutions). The average value of a payment in 2024 on the 
Fedwire Funds Service was $5.4 million, and the median value was approximately $18,000.  
4 Settlement files submitted to NSS can be for an amount up to one penny less than $10 trillion; each entry in a 
settlement file can be for an amount up to one penny less than $100 billion.

large-value domestic financial market transactions, the U.S. dollar leg of many cross-border 

transactions, and private-sector payment clearing arrangements. 5   

The Federal Reserve has consistently improved its payment services to meet the evolving 

needs of the U.S. economy. As technological advancements and globalization of commerce 

continue to drive change in the large-value payment landscape, the Board believes that 

expanding the availability of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS will enhance the safety and 

efficiency of the U.S. payment system by extending the hours in which settlement in risk-free 

central bank money can occur. 6 

B.  2024 Federal Register Notice on Potential Federal Reserve Action 

In May 2024, the Board published a request for comment on a proposal to expand the 

operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. In the 2024 Notice, the Board requested 

comment on the benefits, risks, and implementation considerations of expanding the operating 

hours of the Fedwire Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, every day of the year 

(22x7x365) and to correspondingly expand the operating hours of NSS, with NSS closing 30 

minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. 7 The public comment period for the 2024 Notice 

closed on September 6, 2024, following a 60-day  extension of the original comment period.  

In its 2024 Notice, the Board explained the potential benefits, costs, risks, and other 

considerations related to expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. In particular, 

the Board noted how expanded hours might improve the safety and efficiency of both domestic

Payments Company L.L.C. (TCH). “CHIPS” is a registered service mark of TCH.   

6 Central bank money is a liability of the central bank that can be used for settlement purposes and is considered free 
of credit and liquidity risks. Central bank money has traditionally taken two forms: cash and reserve balances held 
by eligible financial institutions at the central bank. 
7 References to 22x7x365 herein also refer to the corresponding expansion of NSS, unless the context indicates 
otherwise.

and global large-value U.S. dollar payments, spur new or enhanced private-sector payment 

solutions, and increase times available for settlement of large-value consumer and business 

payments in central bank money. The Board also recognized that expanded hours would result in  

greater overlap and reduced gaps in the operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

and key large-value payment services in other jurisdictions. The Board explained that greater 

overlap with the operating hours of other RTGS systems could in turn support more-efficient 

cross-border payments and would be consistent with the actions of other central banks that are 

expanding or considering expanding the operating hours of their large-value payment services. 

The Board recognized in the 2024 Notice the need to weigh the potential benefits of 

expanded hours against the potential costs and risks. The 2024 Notice explained that expanded 

hours would impose costs on both the Reserve Banks and institutions that participate in the 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS due to operational and technical changes. These costs would 

vary by institution, depending on the level of changes and staffing needed to support such a 

change. The 2024 Notice also noted that expanded hours could potentially exacerbate liquidity 

outflows over the weekend and holidays—including for banks under stress—and sought 

comment on the need for discount window operations  to support expanded hours.  

The 2024 Notice sought comments on a number of topics relating to the benefits, costs, 

and risks of expanding the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours. For example, the 

Board sought information on the primary sources of demand for expanded hours, the incremental 

costs associated with expanded hours, and market conditions or barriers that might affect 

adoption of expanded hours. The Board also sought information about how expanded hours 

could support innovation and potential future uses of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, 

whether commenters might prefer an interim expansion of operating hours, timelines for 

Page 5 of 45 

 
implementation, and anticipated liquidity needs in an expanded hours environment. The Board 

also asked how the ability for participants to opt out of expanded hours might introduce benefits 

and challenges and how the initiative to expand operating hours should be considered in light of 

other enhancements or initiatives related to the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. The following 

section summarizes commenters’ views on these questions and on the Board’s proposal in the 

2024 Notice. 

C.  Summary of Comments 

The Board received 145 comment letters in response to the 2024 Notice. Comments were 

submitted by a wide variety of stakeholders in the U.S. payment system, comprising respondents 

from 37 states and corresponding to the following market segments: small and mid-size banks, 

large banks, individuals, trade organizations, service providers, financial market utilities 

(FMUs), fintech companies, private-sector operators, and other interested parties. 8 Overall, 

banks were the largest group of respondents, submitting more than half of the comment letters. 

In addition, a number of trade organizations submitted letters on behalf of constituents in several 

industry segments, including small and midsize banks, large banks, payments associations, 

fintech companies, capital markets participants, businesses, and professional associations.  

8 “Banks” include any type of depository institution, such as commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan 
associations, and credit unions. “Service providers” are entities, such as core payment processors, that provide 
payment services, processing, or operational and technical support to financial institutions. “Financial market 
utilities” are multilateral systems that provide the essential infrastructure for transferring, clearing, and settling 
payments, securities, and other financial transactions among financial institutions or between financial institutions 
and those systems. “Private-sector operators” are entities that operate payment systems, such as the operator of the 
current private-sector RTGS services for large-value and instant payments, and payment card networks. For the 
purposes of this notice, a “small bank” is defined as having assets of less than $10 billion and a “large bank” is 
defined as having assets of more than $50 billion, while a “midsize bank” is defined as having assets between $10 
billion and $50 billion.

1.  Benefits, costs, and risks 

Certain commenter segments expressed clear preferences on the proposal to expand 

operating hours to 22x7x365 based on their particular needs and circumstances in the payment 

system. Most notably, a large majority of respondents from large banks, financial market 

utilities, service providers, and fintech organizations supported the proposal because of the 

benefits outlined in the Board’s 2024 Notice. On the other hand, a large majority of small to 

midsize banks and individuals did not support the proposal, noting that costs and challenges 

related to staffing, operational changes, and competitive pressure from large banks, among other 

considerations, would outweigh any benefits from the proposal. The perspectives of trade 

organizations generally reflected the views of the industry segments that they represent. Trade 

organizations associated with large banks, financial professionals, fintech firms, and payments 

associations were supportive of the proposal and represented the majority of trade organization 

comments. Trade organizations representing small institutions generally were not in favor of the 

proposal, although some of these organizations indicated that certain implementation approaches 

could help alleviate challenges. Some trade organizations presented varied opinions based on 

disparate views within their membership, such as contrasting views among banks of different 

sizes.  

The following subsections summarize themes that commenters raised with respect to the 

benefits, costs, and risks presented by the proposal. The Board’s response to these themes can be 

found in sections II, III, and IV. 

a.  Impact on the U.S. large-value payment system 

Many commenters from large banks, fintech firms, and other groups representing 

financial market stakeholders stated that the proposal would improve safety, efficiency, and 

Page 7 of 45 

 
innovation in both the domestic and global markets for large-value U.S. dollar payments. These 

commenters viewed expansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours to 22x7x365 

as a worthwhile investment to modernize the U.S.’s large-value payment infrastructure, support 

the evolution of markets, and address the growing expectations of consumers and businesses in a 

global economy that operates continuously across time zones. Some commenters from 

institutions of various sizes suggested that large or globally active corporations and financial 

institutions would likely have substantially greater demand and use cases for expanded hours in 

the near term compared with small institutions. Further, a number of commenters from large 

banks, trade organizations representing financial institutions, private-sector operators, and 

fintech firms remarked that the potential benefits associated with expanded operating hours 

would depend on whether banks choose to participate in expanded hours. 9  

b.  Benefits for cross-border payments 

Many commenters from various segments, particularly trade organizations and firms that 

are active in global payments markets, thought that the proposal would support greater speed and 

efficiency in cross-border U.S. dollar payments, such as payments related to international trade, 

commerce, and foreign exchange. In particular, these commenters said the Board’s proposal 

would support new settlement opportunities for the U.S. dollar leg of cross-border payments on 

weekend days and U.S. holidays when other international markets and large-value payment 

systems are open. Some of these commenters anticipated weekend demand for cross-border U.S. 

dollar payments to international markets that operate Sunday-Thursday, including a number of 

markets in the Middle East. Commenters also noted potentially significant demand for cross-

9 Other commenters noted that alignment with other systems and markets is key to fully realizing the benefits 
envisioned in the Board’s proposal. 

Page 8 of 45 

 
 
border U.S. dollar payments on weekday holidays, given that these are regular business days in a 

wide range of international markets. Finally, a number of commenters in this group indicated that 

expanded hours would help maintain U.S. competitiveness in cross-border payment networks 

and would support the role of the U.S. dollar as the preferred currency for global settlement, 

particularly as other payment systems are expanding their operating hours in numerous 

jurisdictions across the world. 

c.  Benefits, costs and risks for domestic payments 

In addition to the international considerations for expanded hours, many commenters 

noted that the Board’s proposal for 22x7x365 operations would affect both large-value and retail 

domestic payments. A number of commenters that supported the proposal, including large banks 

and trade organizations, indicated that expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

would enable more-efficient funding of domestic instant payment services and would support 

other domestic large-value transactions, such as large business invoices; settlement transactions 

for merchants participating in card networks; consumer and commercial loans; transactions 

related to mergers, acquisitions and real estate; and insurance payouts. Some of these 

commenters further noted that such benefits would help ensure that the evolving needs of 

commerce are supported across both retail and wholesale infrastructures. 

Some commenters noted that expanded hours for NSS would provide opportunities for 

private-sector payment systems to conduct multilateral settlement on additional days. 

Specifically, several commenters from payments associations and the U.S. Congress emphasized 

that expanded hours for NSS would enable additional settlement windows for ACH, which could 

support more frequent ACH payments for consumers and businesses, including payments related 

to payroll direct deposits and card-based sales. One commenter from a trade organization added 

Page 9 of 45 

 
that expanded hours for NSS alongside the Fedwire Funds Service would support safer and more 

efficient transactions across all clearing and settlement systems, such as FMUs and retail 

systems. On the other hand, many commenters from a variety of segments, including both small 

and large banks, expressed significant concern that expanding NSS hours could prompt private-

sector ACH and check networks to expand processing days and settlement windows, potentially 

compelling their participants to operate on weekends. In addition, a number of commenters, 

including trade organizations for banks, suggested that expanded processing days and settlement 

windows for ACH and check services would be redundant and inefficient given the availability 

of 24x7 instant payment services, and might disincentivize further industry investment in instant 

payments. Similarly, a private-sector operator of payment systems commented that it would 

prefer to focus investments in its non-instant retail payment services on security, resiliency, and 

fraud mitigation rather than efforts to make those services available around the clock. Relatedly, 

a few commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve and other stakeholders should evaluate the 

costs and benefits of adding new ACH settlement windows through a separate public comment 

process. Most commenters, including trade organizations representing banks of various sizes, 

expressed strong views that the Federal Reserve should not take actions that could encourage 

further check usage, noting that check fraud has grown significantly.  

A few commenters, including two trade associations for banks, noted that private-sector 

operators could use expanded NSS hours as a contingency funding mechanism in the event of a 

Fedwire Funds Service outage, supporting resiliency in the payment system. Finally, certain 

commenters requested that the Federal Reserve clarify its strategy and views with respect to the 

intended uses of different payment systems. The Board’s responses to these considerations are 

addressed in section III.A. 

Page 10 of 45 

 
d.  Impact on liquidity management, credit risk, and innovation 

Many commenters that supported the proposal noted that new settlement opportunities in 

expanded hours could reduce credit risk and support greater efficiency in liquidity management, 

which could also lead to innovation and enhanced services in the payment system, financial 

markets, and the broader economy. Regarding benefits to the payment system, many commenters 

associated with large banks noted that expanded hours would improve the efficiency of the 

private-sector retail instant payment service by allowing participants to manage their liquidity 

needs in the service on a just-in-time basis, reducing the challenges for participants associated 

with prefunding their payment activity ahead of weekends and holidays. A few commenters 

added that expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service could facilitate the expansion of the 

private sector’s large-value payment system to weekends and holidays, which could increase 

benefits to the wholesale payment system.  

Similarly, several fintech organizations noted that expanded hours would provide 

enhanced settlement opportunities and reduce the amount of prefunding that nonbank financial 

institutions (NBFIs) must hold with their commercial banks. Some of these commenters added 

that the safety and efficiency benefits arising from enhanced liquidity management would 

support innovation and growth in NBFI service providers, many of which provide 24x7 services 

and promote the use of the U.S. dollar in global payments. 

Regarding benefits to the banking, corporate, and financial market sectors, some 

commenters from large banks noted that expanded opportunities for settlement of large-value 

payments could be a catalyst for enhancements in bank and corporate treasury functions, 

enabling such functions to more effectively access, manage, and deploy capital to meet day-to-

day needs for operations, investments, and risk management. In addition, some commenters 

Page 11 of 45 

 
noted that broader opportunities for the settlement of time-critical payments would be an 

important step toward enabling additional days for trade settlement in financial markets. Finally, 

some commenters representing FMUs noted that expanded hours could support additional 

collection periods for cash margin and liquidity, which could reduce credit risk and liquidity 

exposures around weekends and holidays and could increase resiliency in periods of market 

stress.  

At the same time, many commenters that did not support the proposal and many that did 

support it noted that expanded hours could bring additional staffing costs and other challenges 

related to liquidity management. A few commenters noted that the expansion of the Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS hours may complicate institutions’ liquidity management amid 

uncertainty over potential payment flows and liquidity sources. Several commenters suggested 

that financial institutions may increase their liquidity positions heading into the weekend or 

ahead of holidays to ensure they will have sufficient liquidity to meet their payments needs. 

Further, a number of commenters asked the Board to address the possibility that 22x7x365 

operations could enable large deposit outflows during weekends and holidays in a bank run 

scenario, potentially exacerbating liquidity issues at banks in stress. A few commenters raised 

questions about the effect of  the proposal on weekend bank resolution. Many of these same 

commenters also expressed support for the Federal Reserve to expand discount window 

operations to support liquidity provisions for both business-as-usual and financial stability 

reasons. Section IV addresses these concerns.  

e.  Demand for large-value payments in expanded hours 

Many commenters provided feedback on the expected demand for payments over the 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS during expanded hours. Most large institutions identified 

Page 12 of 45 

 
several potential sources of demand for expanded hours; in contrast, most small institutions did 

not see immediate demand or business cases for participating in expanded hours, noting that 

instant payments are sufficient to meet their customers’ needs. Other banks stated that potential 

demand is uncertain and suggested further study by the Federal Reserve.  

Some commenters argued that expanding Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours would 

likely shift existing volume to weekends and holidays rather than create demand for new 

transactions. Small banks suggested that this potential shifting dynamic would limit their 

business case for participating in expanded hours, whereas large financial institutions, 

businesses, and fintechs noted that payments tend to accumulate around holidays and weekends, 

so a shift in volume could actually help create a more efficient and predictable flow of payments 

over the week. Large financial institutions and commenters in the capital markets segment added 

that such a change in payment flows could support more efficient capital and liquidity 

management, provide greater funding flexibility and security for their customers, and spur the 

development of markets and innovative services during weekends and holidays. 

f.  Staffing costs and competitive impact 

Staffing considerations represented the most common challenge noted by commenters. 

Over half of commenters that did not support the proposal expressed concern about the burden 

and cost to staff a range of support functions during expanded operating hours. This group of  

commenters, which consisted mostly of small banks, midsize banks, trade organizations 

representing those segments, and individuals, noted that small institutions would face a greater 

staffing burden than large institutions, because small institutions often rely heavily on manual 

processes to support wholesale payment operations, while larger institutions may have greater 

resources for automation and flexible staffing models. A number of small banks and individuals 

Page 13 of 45 

 
expressed concern that expanded hours would harm the quality of life of employees required to 

work during those hours and that it would be difficult to hire qualified staff as a result.  

Many institutions, including those from the small bank and fintech segments, commented 

on the impact expanded hours would have on their ability to compete with other institutions. 

Most small banks thought that expanded hours would widen their competitive gap with large 

banks, noting that large banks are better positioned to offer weekend and holiday wholesale 

payment services in a cost-effective manner. A few of these commenters indicated that small 

banks may feel the need to participate in expanded operating hours to appear competitive despite 

having neither substantial customer demand nor the financial returns to justify participation. On 

the other hand, some commenters associated with large banks and fintech firms noted that 

expanded hours could support competition in the payment system by providing a better platform 

on which both traditional and emerging players can compete in the around-the-clock market for 

payment services.  

g.  Other operational considerations 

Many commenters from various segments noted that, in order to use the proposed 

22x7x365 operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, institutions would need to 

incur certain incremental costs to modify or upgrade systems and operational processes related to 

a range of risk management and business functions, with most small institutions noting that such 

costs would outweigh their potential benefits from the proposal. 10 Other commenters noted that 

costs could be modest to the extent that institutions are able to build on existing infrastructure 

they use to support weekend and holiday operations for other services (for example, 24x7x365 

10 Commenters noted that there could be substantial costs to extend and modify systems and support functions for 
managing fraud risk, credit risk, cyber risk, compliance, accounting, reporting, customer service, and other 
downstream and upstream operations. A number of commenters, particularly from small banks, also cited the need 
for key vendors to be available during expanded hours to support bank operations.   

Page 14 of 45 

 
 
instant payments). Some commenters, including banks and trade organizations representing a 

range of bank sizes, highlighted the need and challenges of providing adequate fraud and cyber 

risk management measures in a 22x7x365 operating environment, given that these risks could be 

elevated during periods when fewer resources may be available to monitor risk controls. The 

Board’s responses to commenters’ concerns related to fraud and cyber risk are discussed in 

section IV. 

In addition, many commenters noted that, in order to participate in 22x7x365 operations 

for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, banks would need to adapt systems and processes to 

operate with limited downtime, which could significantly increase costs and operational risks, 

depending on a participant’s particular level of readiness and the amount of time it has to prepare 

for expanded hours. Commenters explained that existing downtime on weekends provides a key 

window for firms of all sizes to conduct system maintenance, upgrades, and testing to support 

the resilience of firms’ technical infrastructure to operational and cyber incidents. Some 

commenters noted that only two hours of downtime per day in a 22x7x365 operating schedule 

would not provide sufficient downtime to accommodate system changes and other operational 

activities. Given these considerations, commenters from both large and small institutions asked 

for ample time to prepare for expanded hours, with some commenters requesting a phased 

approach that would start by maintaining substantial windows of downtime.  

Many commenters provided feedback on the Board’s proposal to extend its existing 

optional participation model for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS to include expanded 

operating hours. Many commenters from various segments supported the Board’s proposal to 

maintain optionality, with some noting that the model would help participants avoid the costs 

and risks of participation if such participants do not see sufficient benefits. Other commenters 

Page 15 of 45 

 
raised concerns and considerations related to the opt-in model that are addressed in detail in 

section IV. 

2.  Implementation considerations 

a.  Preferences for an interim step and daily operating hours 

A small segment of commenters directly addressed the Board’s question on whether 

commenters would prefer an interim expansion of operating hours before moving to 22x7x365 as 

proposed. Some commenters, primarily representing large banks and fintech firms, did not think 

the Board should pursue an interim expansion short of 22x7x365, because that approach could 

add complexity and cost relative to a single-step expansion to 22x7x365. At the same time, many 

commenters from multiple segments emphasized that the Board’s final decision on operating 

hours should aim to mitigate risks and impacts to participants, and that clarity on the Board’s 

overall path on operating hours would help banks reduce the cost of a phased expansion process.  

A significant number of commenters that responded to the Board’s question preferred a 

phased approach with an initial expansion short of 22x7x365. While many commenters 

representing small institutions were not in favor of expanded hours, a number of these 

commenters suggested that, with sufficient time to adapt, a shorter or phased expansion approach 

could be manageable. Commenters suggested various ideas for an interim step, with no 

consensus on a path forward. Suggestions for an interim step generally included one or a 

combination of the following: excluding federal holidays, excluding weekends, operating six 

days per week instead of seven, and retaining a specified number of down weekends or days per 

year. Many of these commenters noted that an interim step would help participants adapt to new 

operational needs and provide an opportunity to test demand for expanded hours. 

Page 16 of 45 

 
A few commenters indicated preferences for certain changes to the daily operating hours 

of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, although most commenters did not suggest any changes 

to the daily operating schedule of these services for either current or expanded operating days. 

Specifically, a few commenters representing institutions in western U.S. time zones asked for a 

later daily closing time for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, noting that this change would 

better align with the business day in those regions. In addition, one of these commenters asked 

for weekend and holiday operating hours to be limited to 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET to reduce 

staffing and system costs for participants in expanded hours.  

b.  Timeline 

About a quarter of commenters addressed the Board’s question about their preferred 

timeline for implementing expanded hours. Of this group, the majority of commenters, 

consisting of large banks, FMUs, and various trade organizations, were in favor of the Board’s 

proposal to implement expanded hours no sooner than two years after the migration of the 

Fedwire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 standard, which occurred in July 2025. Some 

commenters preferred that the implementation of expanded hours begin no sooner than two years 

after the publication of the Board’s decision on expanded hours. These commenters noted that 

substantial lead time would help the industry adapt staffing, systems, and processes to be ready 

for expanded hours. Some commenters thought that the Board should not delay  the expansion 

beyond two years. Other commenters indicated that the Board should determine the 

implementation date based on when a critical mass of participants are willing and ready to 

participate in expanded hours. 

Page 17 of 45 

 
3.  Other Considerations 

The 2024 Notice asked for feedback on other considerations relevant to an expansion of 

operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. Commenters asked the Board to 

consider impacts on money laundering and sanctions compliance screening, with some 

commenters suggesting the Reserve Banks should conduct such screening. Several commenters 

suggested that expanded operating hours may require changes to the regulatory definitions of 

“banking day” and “business day.” Commenters also raised topics that were outside the scope of 

the proposal. These comments are addressed in detail in section IV.C.6.  

Commenters also provided feedback on the Board’s plan not to expand the operating 

hours of the Fedwire Securities Service at this time, which is addressed in section IV.C.5.  

II. Planned Action 

After consideration of the comments received regarding the benefits, costs, and risks of 

expanding Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours, the Board has decided to expand the 

operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 6 days per week, operating 

Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays (22x6), and to expand the operating hours 

of NSS correspondingly, with NSS closing 30 minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. 

The Board believes that expanding operating hours to 22x6  as an interim step, rather than 

straight to 22x7x365 as originally proposed, balances the considerations raised by different 

stakeholders, particularly the differing views of large and small institutions, and supports the 

Board’s policy objective to foster a safe and efficient U.S. payment system for the long term. 11  

11 As noted elsewhere in the notice, prior to making a decision on a further expansion of operating hours, the Board 
would issue a new proposal and request comments in the Federal Register, and nothing in this notice is binding upon 
the Board to take further steps. 

Page 18 of 45 

 
 
The Board has further decided that the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS will follow the 

same daily operating hours on Sundays and holidays as they do for current business days, with 

the Fedwire Funds Service opening at 9:00 p.m. ET on the calendar day preceding a business day 

and closing at 7:00 p.m. ET on the business day. Based on this schedule, the Fedwire Funds 

Service will retain 26 hours of weekend downtime from its 7:00 p.m. ET close on Friday to 9:00 

p.m. ET on Saturday when it will open for the Sunday business day, providing a weekly period 

for participants and other stakeholders to conduct maintenance and testing. 12 Section IV.A 

explains why the Board determined that 22x6 expanded hours should consist of a Sunday 

operating day and why all operating days, including Sundays and holidays, should operate on the 

same hours.  

After considering public comments on the preferred timeline for implementing expanded 

hours, the Board plans for the Reserve Banks to implement the 22x6 expansion in 2028 or 2029. 

This time frame is intended to provide sufficient time for the industry to complete any remaining 

changes related to the migration of the Fedwire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 standard, which 

was completed in July 2025, and to make any necessary technical and operational changes to 

support expanded hours. The Reserve Banks will update and narrow their implementation time 

frame for 2028 or 2029 based on industry developments and additional outreach to participants, 

with the goal of providing sufficient advance notice to all participants. The final go-live date will 

be informed by industry readiness factors, such as technical and operational considerations. 

Regarding potential future expansions of operating hours beyond 22x6, the Board 

continues to believe and acknowledges comments that 22x7x365 operations could provide 

12 As discussed elsewhere in this notice, specifically section IV, participation in expanded hours is optional, and 
participants are not required by the Federal Reserve to align their business days with Fedwire Funds Service 
business days. 

Page 19 of 45 

 
 
additional benefits to the payment system. As a result, the planned expansion to 22x6 will 

provide the foundational capability for the Reserve Banks to expand operating hours up to 

22x7x365 in the future. The Board will continue to monitor industry demand and will stand 

ready to offer an additional expansion up to 22x7x365 operations no sooner than two years after 

implementing 22x6 operations. The Board believes that implementing 22x6 will provide 

stakeholders with the opportunity to better understand the demand, benefits, costs, risks, and 

operational tradeoffs related to a potential further expansion of operating hours up to 22x7x365. 

Prior to making a decision on a further expansion of operating hours, the Board would  issue a 

new proposal and request comments in the Federal Register. 

III. Assessment of the Planned Action 

In 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal 

Reserve payment services in its policy “The Federal Reserve in the Payments System.” 13 The 

policy incorporates the cost recovery requirements of the MCA and the MCA’s objective of 

achieving an adequate level of service nationwide. In expressing the Board’s overall expectations 

for the Federal Reserve’s provision of payment services, the policy takes into account 

longstanding public policy objectives to promote the safety and efficiency of the payment system 

and to ensure the provision of payment services to banks nationwide on an equitable basis, and 

the importance of achieving these objectives in an atmosphere of competitive fairness.  

Reflecting these expectations, the policy requires all of the following criteria to be met 

for a major service enhancement, such as the expansion of the operating hours of  the Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS to 22x6:  

13 See The Federal Reserve in the Payments System (issued 1984; revised 1990 and 2001), Federal Reserve 
Regulatory Service 9-1558, https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm. As stated in the 
policy, the Board, in its sole discretion, determines when the process outlined in the policy is applicable and makes 
all decisions related to the process. 

Page 20 of 45 

 
 
•  The Federal Reserve must expect that its providing the service will yield a clear public 

benefit, including, for example, promoting the integrity of the payments system, 

improving the effectiveness of financial markets, reducing the risk associated with 

payments and securities-transfer services, or improving the efficiency of the payments 

system. (Public Benefits Criterion) 

•  The service should be one that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with 

reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. (Other Providers Criterion) 

•  The Federal Reserve must expect to achieve full recovery of costs over the long run. 

(Cost Recovery Criterion)  

The following sections provide the Board’s assessment of the proposed action under 

these three criteria.  

A.  Public Benefit 

The Board’s Public Benefits Criterion requires that a major service enhancement yield 

long-term benefits to the public and the economy as a whole. Therefore, in determining whether 

the Federal Reserve should expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS to 

22x6, the Board has considered the expected public benefits and potential offsetting costs of 

expanded operating hours. 

1. 

Public Comments  

As described above in section I.C, the benefits of expanded hours noted in the public 

comments generally align with the potential benefits outlined in the 2024 Notice. In summary, 

comments in support of the Board’s proposal highlighted benefits such as enabling certain use 

cases (for example, cross-border U.S. dollar payments, corporate invoice payments, commercial 

loan payments, insurance, and real estate payments), supporting enhanced liquidity management 

Page 21 of 45 

 
for a range of participants in the payment system, supporting the role of the U.S. dollar as the 

preferred currency for global settlement, and investing in foundational infrastructure to support 

the future evolution of the payments system.  

More specifically related to an expansion of hours for NSS, commenters noted that 

benefits would include the potential for additional settlement windows for private-sector 

arrangements that use NSS for final settlement of net payment obligations. Some commenters 

added that NSS also serves as a potential backup funding and settlement mechanism for critical 

arrangements that typically use the Fedwire Funds Service. Expanding NSS operating hours in 

line with Fedwire Funds Service hours would preserve the contingency relationship between 

these two services. 

Small institutions raised concerns about the costs and market pressures that could arise 

under the Board’s original proposal for 22x7x365 operations. In particular, small institutions 

noted that they did not see significant customer demand for expanded hours, and that 

participation would bring significant costs and challenges related to staffing, operational, and 

system changes. Further, many small institutions expressed concern that participation would not 

be optional in practice due to market factors, even though the Federal Reserve itself would not 

require participation in expanded hours. Specifically, these commenters worried that competitive 

pressure from large banks that offer expanded wire services may force small banks to participate 

in expanded hours over time. Contributing to this sentiment, both small and large institutions 

expressed concern that expanded hours for NSS could lead to the introduction of new weekend 

settlement windows for ACH and check.  

Page 22 of 45 

 
2. 

Board Analysis 

After considering public comments on the proposal, the Board believes that an expansion 

of operating hours to 22x6 would provide clear public benefits. In particular, 22x6 operations 

will provide opportunities for more frequent settlement in central bank money that could enhance 

safety and efficiency in a range of payments, including cross-border U.S. dollar payments, large-

value corporate payments, and funding payments for private-sector payment systems and market 

participants. 

The Board believes that expanding the hours of the Fedwire Funds Service would support 

the role of the U.S. dollar as the preferred currency for global settlement by expanding the 

foundational infrastructure on which global U.S. dollar settlement relies. Such an investment 

would support U.S. competitiveness in cross-border payments networks, particularly as other 

countries and global payment systems are increasingly providing services for nearly round-the-

clock large-value payments. 

The Board also believes that expanding Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours 

to 22x6 will support enhanced liquidity management for participants and private-sector payment 

systems, and indirectly for their customers, by allowing large-value cash obligations and 

exposures to be settled more quickly, reducing the need for market participants to prefund 

transactions ahead of weekends and weekday holidays.  

The Board further believes that the potential safety and efficiency benefits of 22x6 

operations could enable enhanced and innovative services in the private sector over time. For 

example, private-sector payment systems and participants may leverage an enhanced foundation 

for large-value settlement to support expanded trading days or enhanced payment services, 

providing additional benefits to the broader economy. 

Page 23 of 45 

 
The Board understands the concerns raised by small institutions regarding the costs and 

market pressures that could arise in an expanded operating hours environment. The Board’s 

action in this notice to expand operating hours to 22x6 as an interim step is intended to reduce 

adjustment costs and challenges for participants relative to an expansion straight to 22x7x365, 

while still enabling substantial benefits. Further, the Board believes that the ability to opt out of 

expanded hours will reduce costs to participants that do not see a business case for participating, 

notwithstanding certain concerns raised by some commenters about optional participation that 

are addressed in more detail below. 14 

Regarding NSS expansion, while the Board agrees with the benefits noted by 

commenters, the Board also acknowledges the challenges raised by commenters with respect to 

NSS expansion enabling the possibility of weekend ACH and check settlement. The Board is 

clarifying that the Federal Reserve has no current plans to seek expanded processing hours for 

Federal Reserve ACH and check services. Regarding ACH, changes to processing days would be 

subject to the Nacha rulemaking process. 15 Additionally, the Board would likely need to seek 

public comment before committing to any additional same-day or weekend ACH processing 

windows, which would have a significant longer-run effect on the payment system. 16  

14 Currently, the Reserve Banks do not require participants to be open to process transactions through the Fedwire 
Funds Service or NSS during all hours of the business day for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS.  As a result, 
some participants may opt out of participating in certain hours of the day (such as during overnight hours) by not 
being open to process transactions during those times. As further explained in section IV.C.1, the Reserve Banks 
will retain this optional participation model for expanded hours.

Administrator of the ACH Network, https://www.nacha.org/content/about-us.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/board-staff-comment-letter-to-nacha-2024-12-13.pdf. (noting 
that the Board would likely need to seek public comment before adding more same-day ACH processing windows).  

Page 24 of 45 

 
 
The Board also acknowledges public comments that expanded Fedwire Funds Service 

operating hours could blur the lines between the usage of the Fedwire Funds Service and the 

Federal Reserve’s other RTGS service, the FedNow Service, which operates around the clock. 17 

The Board is clarifying that the benefits articulated in this notice for expanded Fedwire Funds 

Service hours are specific to the types of payments and markets that the Fedwire Funds Service 

is intended to support. While the Fedwire Funds Service and the FedNow Service both settle 

payments in real time, they serve different purposes. Among other things, the Fedwire Funds 

Service plays a critical role in the implementation of United States monetary policy, is used for 

time-critical and large-value payments in the financial markets, and supports the role of the U.S. 

dollar in global settlement. In contrast, the FedNow Service is designed to provide immediate 

funds availability for lower-value consumer and business transactions. 18 The Board encourages 

banks to use the Fedwire Funds Service and FedNow Service according to the payment types and 

use cases that the services are intended to support.    

B.  Other Providers 

Board policy requires that for a major service change, the service should be one that other 

providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. 

The measures of scope and equity reflect the Federal Reserve’s objective of ensuring adequate 

provision of payment services nationwide on an equitable basis. The effectiveness measure 

17 The FedNow Service is the Federal Reserve’s 24x7x365 real-time gross settlement service that supports instant 
payments in the United States. The service is intended for lower-value payments that are generally originated by 
consumers and businesses. “FedNow” is a service mark of the Federal Reserve Banks.  
18 The FedNow Service has a $1 million limit on the maximum transaction value of a payment. Effective November 
2025, this transaction limit will be increased to $10 million. The FedNow Service is designed to support end-to-end 
instant payments from a sender to a receiver by providing immediate funds availability for end users, such as 
consumers and businesses. Over time, it is expected that banks will increasingly provide their customers with new 
applications and other digital services for time-critical payments such as last-minute bill payments, daily payroll, 
real estate transactions, and emergency insurance payouts. 

Page 25 of 45 

 
 
addresses the extent to which other providers alone can be expected to advance desirable 

outcomes in the U.S. payment system.  

In considering public comments on the proposal and the Fedwire Funds Service’s and 

NSS’s roles in the payment system, the Board believes that other providers alone could not 

provide equivalent services to expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS as 

described in more detail below. 

1. 

Public Comments 

Many commenters that did not support the proposal, mostly consisting of individuals and 

small institutions, questioned the need for expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS when instant payment services already support 24x7x365 payments. However, several 

commenters from large institutions note that the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS serve certain 

use cases with respect to wholesale and cross-border payments that are not served by instant 

payment or other services. The previous section provides further detail on the differences 

between Fedwire Funds Service and instant payment services. 

Many comments also noted that the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS serve important 

roles in providing final settlement in central bank money and in supporting the safe and efficient 

flow of liquidity throughout the payment system and broader economy.  

The private-sector operator of large-value and instant payment services expressed support 

for expanding the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service, noting that the expansion would 

enable more efficient funding of the operator’s instant payment service and could facilitate a 

potential future expansion of the operator’s large-value payment service to weekends and 

holidays.

Board Analysis 

In response to comments that existing instant payment systems negate the need for 

expanding Fedwire Funds Service operating hours in particular, the Board notes that the Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS serve certain use cases with respect to wholesale and cross-border 

payments that are not served by instant payment or other services. Section III.A.2 provides 

further detail on the differences between Fedwire Funds Service and instant payment services.  

With respect to effectiveness, as commenters noted, the Federal Reserve has a unique and 

critical role in providing foundational services that enable direct settlement of critical payment 

obligations in central bank money. Specifically, institutions of all sizes as well as other payment, 

clearing, and settlement services rely on the Fedwire Funds Service as the backbone for final 

settlement and funding of critical payments in risk-free central bank money. Similarly, NSS 

provides a safe and efficient foundation for payment, clearing, and settlement arrangements to 

conduct multilateral settlement of critical large-value payments in central bank money. Financial 

markets build on the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS to provide safer, more efficient, 

innovative, and expanded services to end users throughout the economy.  

Given these considerations, enhancements to the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, such 

as expanded operating hours, support broader enhancements to safety, efficiency, and innovation 

in the payment system that other providers could not be expected to provide alone. For example, 

the Board notes that the private-sector large-value payment service relies on the Fedwire Funds 

Service for funding payments in central bank money to support its settlement process. For this 

reason and as noted in the private-sector operator’s comment letter, the Board’s proposal could 

facilitate a similar expansion in the operating hours of the private-sector large-value payment 

service. Ultimately, the Board believes there are no exact substitutes for Fedwire Fund Service’s 

Page 27 of 45 

 
and NSS’s roles in providing foundational infrastructure for the payment system and the 

economy. 

In terms of scope and equity, today the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS are broadly 

accessible to eligible institutions across the country on equal terms, and the Federal Reserve 

would continue to offer participants broad access to the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS during 

expanded operating hours. Thus, the Federal Reserve could offer institutions similarly broad 

access to expanded operating hours. 

C.  Cost Recovery 

Section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act, as added by the MCA, requires that fees for 

Federal Reserve Bank payment services be set in accordance with the principle that, over the 

long run, those fees recover the costs of providing the services. 19 In addition, Board policy 

specifies that each major service category offered by the Federal Reserve must separately satisfy 

the cost recovery objective of the MCA: in the long run, aggregate revenues should match 

costs. 20 This section provides the Board’s assessment of the proposal against these requirements, 

taking into account relevant public feedback on the proposal. 

1. 

Public Comments 

The Board notes that commenters did not provide specific views on cost recovery in 

response to the 2024 Notice. Instead, commenters’ feedback was generally focused on their own 

expected costs, use cases, and demand for expanded hours as discussed in the summary of 

19 In particular, section 11A provides that, “[o]ver the long run, fees shall be established on the basis of all direct and 
indirect costs actually incurred in providing the Federal Reserve services priced, including interest on items credited 
prior to actual collection, overhead, and an allocation of imputed costs which takes into account the taxes that would 
have been paid and the return on capital that would have been provided had the services been furnished by a private 
business firm, except that the pricing principles shall give due regard to competitive factors and the provision of an 
adequate level of such services nationwide.” 12 U.S.C. 248a. 

20 The Federal Reserve in the Payments System, supra note 1313. 

Page 28 of 45 

 
 
comments above. The Board has considered commenter feedback on expected demand and taken 

a conservative view of how expanded hours might affect the overall growth in Fedwire Funds 

Service and NSS payment volumes, which in turn affects how the Board anticipates the service 

will recover costs in the long run. 

2. 

Board Analysis 

The Board believes that the Reserve Banks would be able to achieve full recovery of 

costs over the long run associated with the proposed 22x6 expanded operating hours. The MCA 

does not specify the “long-run” period over which the Federal Reserve must recover service 

costs, nor does the legislative history indicate that Congress intended it to be a specific period. 

The Board has typically used a rolling ten-year period when assessing long-run recovery of 

existing services. Because the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS are mature services, the Board 

believes it is appropriate to evaluate cost recovery for expanding Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS to 22x6 operating hours over a ten-year period.   

Public comments that discussed the need for expanded hours to support cross-border 

activity, innovative use cases, and additional settlement opportunities for systemically important 

and large-value transactions support the Board’s own assessment that, over time, expanding 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours would generate increases in volume and revenue. The 

Board’s cost recovery analysis also factors in the views of some commenters that expanded 

hours would likely shift existing volume to weekends and holidays rather than create demand for 

new transactions. In addition, the Reserve Banks’ cost recovery analysis factored in expected 

costs for system changes and additional staffing during the weekends. The Board continues to 

expect that these costs would be offset by increased Reserve Bank revenue, subject to various 

factors such as the competitive and/or economic environment in future years, new product 

Page 29 of 45 

 
enhancement opportunities, and potential Fedwire Funds Service and NSS pricing changes. In 

addition, Reserve Bank operational costs may be lower for expanded hours due to efficiency 

gains that could arise from leveraging operations and customer support staff that are already in 

place for the FedNow Service.  

IV. Implementation Details and Considerations 

The following section provides a general description of key implementation details and 

considerations related to the Board’s announcement in this notice, including a general 

explanation of the Board’s decision to implement 22x6 operating hours for the Fedwire Funds 

Service and NSS, details on the implementation timeline, the Board’s views on potential future 

expansions beyond 22x6, plans for providing a participant directory to support 22x6 operations, 

fraud risk considerations, liquidity and credit risk considerations, and other factors related to 

implementation raised in the public comments.  

A.  Implementation of 22x6 operating hours in 2028-2029 

After considering public comments on the proposal, the Board believes that 22x6 

operating hours that include Sundays and weekday holidays will achieve a substantial amount of 

the benefits of 22x7x365 operating hours, while balancing the requests of many commenters for 

a phased or shorter expansion that maintains significant periods of downtime. The Board notes 

that initial demand for expanded operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service, particularly with 

respect to cross-border payments, is most evident on Sundays and weekday holidays when 

international markets and other jurisdictions’ large-value RTGS systems are operating. In 

addition, an expansion to Sundays and holidays could support more timely settlement of 

payments that currently accumulate around those down periods.  

Page 30 of 45 

 
Currently, the Fedwire Funds Service is open from 9:00 p.m. ET of the preceding 

calendar day to 7:00 p.m. ET, five days per week, Monday through Friday excluding holidays 

observed by the Reserve Banks, and NSS is open from 9:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET, five days per 

week, Monday through Friday excluding holidays observed by the Reserve Banks. The Board 

has decided to use the existing daily operating schedule for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

in expanded hours. With respect to the Fedwire Funds Service, the Board believes that 

maintaining a 9:00 p.m. ET open on the preceding calendar day for Sundays and holidays would 

support potential demand for overnight cross-border and foreign exchange transactions just as 

the 9:00 p.m. ET open supports such transactions during current business days. The Board 

understands the requests of a few commenters for a later closing time to better accommodate the 

business day in western U.S. time zones. However, the Board believes that changing the closing 

at this time would be disruptive to end-of-day processes and other business conventions at 

participants and the Federal Reserve. Further, extending the closing time would require delaying 

the opening time, which could impede the international use cases of the Fedwire Funds Service. 

The Board notes that commenters that supported the proposal generally did not suggest changing 

the opening and closing times for the services.  

The Board has decided not to expand hours to Saturdays at this time because of  the 

heightened challenges of Saturday operations relative to the potential benefits. In particular, the 

Board understands that many participants and the Reserve Banks currently use Saturday for 

conducting system maintenance, testing, and upgrades, so maintaining downtime on Saturdays 

could help participants reduce operational and cyber risk as the market adapts to additional 

Page 31 of 45 

 
Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating days. 21 Further, some commenters noted—and the 

Board recognizes—that weekend downtime provides a helpful pause for financial market 

stakeholders during periods of market stress. The Board believes that maintaining downtime on 

Saturday would support stakeholders that have historically used this time to manage market 

stress events. This downtime may be beneficial for financial stability as stakeholders adapt to 

financial activity increasingly occurring over more days. 

As noted above, the Board plans to correspondingly expand the operating hours of NSS, 

with NSS closing 30 minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. The Board believes that 

expanded hours for NSS would complement expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service, 

providing eligible institutions and private-sector payment, clearing, and settlement services with 

wider opportunities for real-time gross and multilateral net settlement of large-value payments in 

central bank money, which would support greater safety, efficiency, and innovation in the 

payment system. 22 Further, the Board agrees with commenters that expanded hours for NSS 

would support resiliency in the payment system because private-sector services are able to use 

NSS as a backup to the Fedwire Funds Service in contingency scenarios.  

The Board recognizes that some commenters asked for NSS operating hours to not be 

expanded at this time primarily because of concerns about NSS enabling the possibility of new 

ACH and check settlement windows on weekends, which could bring significant challenges for 

some institutions. As discussed in detail in sections III.A.2 and IV.C.1, the Federal Reserve has 

21 The Board notes that, from time to time, Federal Reserve Financial Services (FRFS) announces extended weekend 
maintenance windows in advance. In 22x6 operations, FRFS will retain the ability to announce extended 
maintenance windows, which could extend beyond the 26 hours of regular downtime between Friday and Sunday 
operating days. 
22 Expanding the operating hours of NSS is consistent with a goal of the Federal Reserve’s 2015 paper “Strategies 
for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” which noted that expanded hours for NSS could improve the settlement 
speed of and support innovation in private-sector arrangements. 

Page 32 of 45 

 
 
no current plans to seek expanded processing hours for Federal Reserve ACH and check 

services. Further, the Board believes that these challenges raised by commenters warrant careful 

consideration through public consultation processes before any expansion of ACH or check 

settlement into the weekend or holidays.   

As discussed above, the Federal Reserve intends to implement 22x6 operating hours for 

the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS between 2028 and 2029, with  a specific time frame for 

launch to be determined based on participant readiness and outreach through established Reserve 

Bank communication channels, such as FRBservices.org. The Board believes that this time 

frame is consistent with requests from most commenters for a minimum two-year period to 

prepare for expanded hours following publication of this notice.  

B.  Potential future expansions beyond 22x6 

Commenters that supported the proposal generally thought that the Board should expand 

operating hours to 22x7x365. The Board believes that an expansion first to 22x6 as an interim 

step would help the industry adjust to expanded operating days in the near term. At the same 

time, the Board agrees that expanding to 22x7x365 operations in the future could increase the 

benefits discussed in this notice. The Board will continue to monitor industry demand and will 

stand ready to offer an additional expansion up to 22x7x365 operations no sooner than two years 

after implementing 22x6 operations. Further, the Reserve Banks will continue to collect feedback 

from participants on their service needs through the Reserve Banks’ regular participant 

engagement channels. The Board believes that the process of implementing 22x6 will provide 

stakeholders with the opportunity to develop a better understanding of the demand, benefits, 

costs, risks, and operational tradeoffs to further expansion of operating hours to 22x7x365. Given 

that these considerations related to 22x7x365 operations are likely to evolve as the industry 

Page 33 of 45 

 
prepares for or adapts to 22x6 operations, the Board would solicit comments through a Federal 

Register notice prior to further expansion of operating hours. 

C.  Other operational considerations for 22x6 operations 

1. 

Opt-in model for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

A number of commenters provided feedback on the Board’s proposal to maintain 

optional participation in the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS during expanded hours. While 

many commenters acknowledged that the Federal Reserve itself will not require banks to 

participate in expanded hours, many small bank commenters and related trade organizations 

expressed concern that small institutions may feel competitive pressure to participate if large 

institutions choose to offer payment services that leverage the Fedwire Funds Service during 

expanded hours. In addition, many commenters from a range of market segments expressed 

concern that private-sector arrangements that use NSS could expand processing days and 

settlement windows to the weekend and require their participants to participate under the terms 

of the arrangements. Finally, a few commenters noted that maintaining an opt-in model could, 

over time, hinder sufficient adoption in expanded hours and the ability to achieve the benefits 

stated in the Board’s proposal.  

The Federal Reserve is committed to offering flexible, reliable, and secure payment 

processing and settlement, and the opt-in availability to participants remains a key component of 

the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. As noted in the Board’s 2024 Notice and in some public 

comments, the opt-in model would help participants avoid costs and challenges related to 

Page 34 of 45 

 
expanded hours if they do not see a sufficient benefit in using such hours—flexibility that 

participants use today if they do not see a need to participate in overnight operating hours. 23 

Regarding NSS expansion, the availability of NSS on weekends and holidays could, in 

theory, enable private-sector ACH and check arrangements to add new settlement windows 

during these expanded hours, and potentially require their participants to participate. However, 

as stated above, the Board does not anticipate expanding check processing days and believes that 

expansion of the Federal Reserve’s ACH processing windows would likely require  public 

comment, through which the Board would consider the benefits and costs to institutions from 

expansion of such services.   

2. 

Other enhancements to the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

About a fifth of commenters addressed the Board’s question about whether other service 

enhancements would be beneficial in the context of expanded hours. Among these commenters, 

the most requested enhancement was for a participant directory that would identify which 

Fedwire Funds Service participants are active during expanded hours. These commenters noted 

that such a directory could support more efficient payment flows and help prevent trapped 

liquidity in the network of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS participants.  

Given that a broad theme from public comments was that the Federal Reserve should take 

steps to support liquidity management in expanded hours, the Federal Reserve intends to 

23 Even if a participant chooses not to operate during some or all of the Fedwire Funds Service or NSS hours, the 
Reserve Banks would continue to deliver Fedwire Funds Service payment orders or NSS transactions sent to the 
participant during those times and settle those transactions by crediting the participant’s Reserve Bank settlement 
account, as they do today. For the Fedwire Funds Service, if a Sunday or holiday is not a funds-transfer business day 
for a participant, or the participant establishes cutoff times for the receipt of payment orders on those days, the 
participant would not be required to act on payment orders received on those days or after those cutoff times, 
respectively, until its next funds-transfer business day. For NSS, if a participant does not settle NSS transactions 
during part or all of a Sunday or holiday, it may be unable to send or receive transactions through the private-sector 
clearing arrangement during those times depending on the rules of the clearing arrangement. The Reserve Banks will 
retain this optional participation model for expanded hours. The 2024 Notice describes in greater detail the optional 
participation model and implications for participants. 89 FR 39613, 39618–19. 

Page 35 of 45 

 
 
consider developing a participant directory. The Reserve Banks will engage with participants to 

solicit feedback on whether and how to implement any directory.  

3. 

Fraud risk 

Comments received in response to the 2024 Notice emphasized the heightened risk of 

fraud during expanded hours and noted the importance of fraud-monitoring staff and tools to aid 

in mitigating fraud risk. Some commenters noted that in the current operating environment, fraud 

risk is often greater during weekends and holidays, and that institutional risk controls will need 

to adjust to anticipate automated and staffing solutions during extended hours. The Board agrees 

that strong mechanisms are necessary to support the overall safety and efficiency of the nation’s 

payment system. The Board is exploring ways the Federal Reserve  could mitigate payments 

fraud within its specific authorities. The Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and 

the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a Request for Information seeking input 

and engagement from a variety of stakeholders to identify and evaluate the range of potential 

actions they could consider, including in the Federal Reserve’s role as a payments system 

operator. 24 The agencies are assessing comments in response to that Request for Information. 

4. 

Liquidity and Credit  

Comments in response to the 2024 Notice indicated concerns about adequate liquidity 

being available to support expanded operating hours on weekends and holidays. To support their 

current payment services, the Reserve Banks provide liquidity in the form of intraday credit, also 

known as daylight overdrafts, to eligible banks and subject to the Federal Reserve’s Policy on 

Payment System Risk (PSR Policy). 25 Intraday credit supports the smooth functioning of the 

24 90 FR 26293 (June 20, 2025). 
25 Intraday credit is generally available to banks that are financially healthy and have regular access to the discount 
window (the Federal Reserve’s program for overnight lending to banks). See Board of Governors of the Federal 

Page 36 of 45 

 
 
 
payment system by supplying temporary liquidity to cover shortages that can result when the 

timing of payment inflows and outflows are not balanced.  

The Federal Reserve intends to provide intraday credit for Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS transactions during expanded hours under the same terms and conditions that the services 

receive during their current operating hours. As is the case today, participating banks would be 

expected to manage their master accounts in compliance with Federal Reserve policies, including 

avoiding overnight overdrafts. 26 These expectations would apply over weekends and holidays, 

given that the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS would operate 22x6.  

Account balance management may become more complex in a 22x6 environment and 

require attention on Sundays and weekday holidays. Participating banks may need to adjust 

internal account monitoring practices to manage intraday liquidity. Liquidity management would 

be particularly important to avoid a negative balance at the close of the Fedwire Funds Service 

operating day. Specifically, banks would need to carefully monitor transactions in real time or 

ensure that sufficient funding is available in their master accounts to cover payments that may 

arise shortly before the service’s closing. 27 A few commenters suggested that the Board treat all 

extensions of credit from Reserve Banks as intraday credit on weekends and holidays until the 

next weekday business day. A few commenters suggested that, because market funding sources 

may be limited during the proposed expanded hours, institutions should not be required to fund 

daylight overdrafts at close of business to prevent overnight overdrafts during expanded hours 

Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk,” Part II,  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm.  
26 To minimize Reserve Bank exposure to overnight overdrafts, policy established by the Board discourages 
institutions from incurring overnight overdrafts by charging a penalty fee.  See id., Part III. 
27 The Reserve Bank’s Account Management Information (AMI) service provides a near–real time view of account 
balances. Institutions could use AMI or other internal systems for monitoring account balances. 

Page 37 of 45 

 
 
but rather they should be able to fund them on the next weekday business day. One commenter 

suggested a reduction in overnight overdraft penalties during expanded hours if the discount 

window is not available. 

The 2024 Notice sought comment on the need for discount window operations to support 

expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. 28 Commenters that directly addressed 

this question, including commenters from large banks, trade associations representing a range of 

bank sizes and capital markets participants, financial market utilities, and private-sector 

operators, recommended that the Federal Reserve extend discount window operations to include 

weekends and holidays. Several of these comments further indicated that the discount window’s 

operating hours should be fully aligned with the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours to 

support liquidity management (that is, it should operate for 22 hours each day). Many 

commenters pointed to uncertainty over payments activity on weekend and holidays as likely to 

complicate firms’ end-of-day liquidity management, and more than 10 comments reported that 

banks were likely to increase their liquidity positions heading into weekends and holidays to 

ensure sufficient liquidity to meet uncertain payment needs. A few commenters noted that 

expanded operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS would raise the prospect of a 

bank experiencing potentially rapid deposit outflows on weekends or holidays. In this scenario, 

the discount window may mitigate risk of contagion to other institutions. Finally, some 

commenters that did not support the proposal, including some small institutions and trade 

organizations representing small institutions, nevertheless indicated that if the Board does decide 

to pursue expanded operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, then discount 

28 The discount window is a Federal Reserve lending facility that helps to relieve liquidity strains for individual 
banks and for the banking system as a whole by providing a reliable backup source of funding. Additional 
information on the discount window is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/discount-window.htm.  

Page 38 of 45 

 
 
window operating hours should be expanded as well. Most commenters that did not support the 

proposal did not address the Board’s question on the discount window. 

About half of the comments that supported expanding discount window operations 

emphasized that private sources of overnight funding for banks were likely to be scarce or 

completely unavailable on weekends or holidays. Several noted that existing wholesale funding 

markets do not operate on weekends and holidays and are not likely to emerge, particularly with 

the Federal Reserve not considering the expansion of the Fedwire Securities Service at this 

time. 29 Several of these commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve consider additional 

options to support banks’ liquidity management on weekends and holidays, for example by 

operating the standing repurchase (repo) facility, or by opening both the Fedwire Securities 

Service and the Reserve Banks’ collateral management system to allow banks to transfer 

securities collateral to the discount window. 30  

The Board recognizes that depository institutions will need ready access to a range of 

robust liquidity sources as (i) the FedNow Service continues to mature and (ii) the operating days 

of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS expand to include weekends and holidays. The Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS have transaction limits of up to one penny less than $10 billion per 

payment order and one penny less than $10 trillion per settlement file, respectively. Given the 

potentially large size of these transactions, it is particularly important that adequate liquidity 

sources are available on days that the Fedwire Funds Service is operational. As a result and 

recognizing the comments received on this topic, the Federal Reserve is exploring expanding 

29 As explained in the 2024 Notice, the Board is not considering expanding Fedwire Securities Service operating 
hours at this time. 89 FR 39613, 39620 (May 9, 2024). The Board addresses public comments on this topic in 
Section IV.C.5 below. 
30 A few commenters expressed a desire for Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) to operate on weekends and 
holidays to provide an alternative source of liquidity. FHLB operations are outside the scope of the 2024 Notice. 

Page 39 of 45 

 
 
discount window operating days in connection with the expansion of the Fedwire Funds Service. 

As part of this exploration, the Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional outreach to 

stakeholders to ensure it fully understands the benefits and costs of expanded discount window 

operations for institutions of various sizes.  

Regarding Federal Reserve credit, the Board notes that the Federal Reserve is not 

adjusting fees or the framework for the treatment of daylight and overnight overdrafts occurring 

on weekends and holidays. As a result, all daylight and overnight overdrafts will be treated 

consistently regardless of when these overdrafts occur.  

5. 

Fedwire Securities Service 

A small number of comments on the 2024 Notice asked for the operating hours of the 

Fedwire Securities Service to be extended alongside the hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS, while other commenters agreed with the Board’s reasons for excluding the Fedwire 

Securities Service from its proposal. Commenters that requested Fedwire Securities Service 

operating hours be expanded cited several needs for the Fedwire Securities Service during 

weekends and holidays, including needs related to market liquidity, secured financing and repo 

markets, collateralization with respect to market exposures, and Federal Reserve credit and 

liquidity facilities. Some commenters that did not support expanded hours for the Fedwire 

Securities Service at this time thought it would be helpful for the Federal Reserve to conduct a 

feasibility study with the industry on the costs and benefits of a potential future expansion. 

The Board is not considering expanding the operating hours for the Fedwire Securities 

Service at this time. 31 The Board continues to believe that the expansion of Fedwire Funds 

31 The Fedwire Securities Service is currently open for transfers between participants from 8:30 a.m. ET until 3:30 
p.m. ET Monday through Friday, excluding holidays observed by the Reserve Banks. In addition, Fedwire Securities 
Service participants may reposition securities between their own securities accounts from 8:30 a.m. ET until 7:00 
p.m. ET on those same weekdays. 

Page 40 of 45 

 
 
Service and NSS operating hours will not create significant changes in secured lending, 

derivatives markets, or other market activity that would necessitate expanded operating hours for 

the Fedwire Securities Service in the near term. After considering public comments on the 

proposal, the Board also continues to believe that the aggregate value of transfers during current 

off-hours for the large-value payment services will likely be relatively low at the outset and thus 

unlikely to result in increased demand for securities transfers during those hours. The Board 

agrees with some commenters that, in the longer term, expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds 

Service and NSS could influence markets, which could in turn increase demand for the Fedwire 

Securities Service during current off-hours. The Board also acknowledges that, under the 

Board’s current approach, participants will need to anticipate needs for and pledge securities in 

the Fedwire Securities Service in advance of weekends and weekday holidays. The Board will 

continue to monitor potential demand and seek feedback from institutions to determine whether 

to pursue a future expansion of Fedwire Securities Service operating hours. 

6. 

Other considerations 

Commenters raised a number of considerations related to the implementation of 

expanded hours that were not discussed in detail in the 2024 Notice. This section provides the 

Board’s response to these additional topics.  

At least one commenter suggested that the Federal Reserve implement and perform 

centralized screening to ensure compliance with Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) 

requirements for Fedwire Funds Service customers to ease the burden on those that participate in 

expanded hours. While the Board understands that such a change would have certain benefits to 

participants, the Board does not believe it appropriate for Reserve Banks to conduct screening on 

Page 41 of 45 

 
behalf of financial institutions and notes such screening would not replace a financial 

institution’s obligation to comply with OFAC requirements. 

Several commenters asked whether the Board would amend the definitions of “banking 

day” and “business day” in Regulation CC if the Fedwire Funds Service expanded into the 

weekend and holidays. Some commenters also raised this as a consideration if ACH and check 

activities are expanded into the weekend or holidays. The Board notes that no amendments to 

Regulation CC are needed to facilitate the expanded hours because in-scope depository 

institutions are (i) deemed not to receive funds from wire transfers on weekends or holidays for 

Regulation CC purposes and (ii) not required to make funds from wire transfers available for 

withdrawal on weekends or holidays. 32 Banks are similarly deemed not to receive ACH and 

check funds on the weekend or legal holidays under Regulation CC and not required to make 

funds available on those days.33 Relatedly, a commenter also noted that private parties often rely 

on the Fedwire Funds Service operating day for contractual definitions, including for defining 

the term business day. The Board believes that these parties will be able to adapt their contracts 

after the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours are expanded.   

32 Regulation CC implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFFA) (12 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) and the Check 
Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21 Act) (12 U.S.C. 5001 et seq.). 12 CFR § 229.1(a). Among other things, 
EFAA requires in-scope depository institutions to make funds from wire transfers available for withdrawal not later 
than the business day after the business day on which such funds are received for deposit. “Business day” in EFAA 
is defined not to include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays. Any funds deposited with an institution on those 
days are deemed not to be deposited for EFAA purposes until the next business day, and banks are not required to 
make funds available on those days. Regulation CC aligns with EFAA, except that the time for making funds from 
wire transfers available under Regulation CC starts only on a “banking day” for the institution. “Banking day” is 
defined in Regulation CC as the part of any business day (defined as any weekday excluding specified holidays) on 
which an office of a bank is open to the public. Funds received on a day that is not a banking day for the depository 
institution are considered deposited on the next banking day. Id., §§ 229.2(f), 229.10(b) & 229.19(a)(5).

Several commenters asked about the potential regulatory impact of expanded hours, 

particularly with respect to liquidity regulations such as Regulation WW and Regulation YY. 34 

The Board notes that its decision on expanded hours does not change the legal standards for 

liquidity risk management. Institutions remain responsible for ensuring that their liquidity risk 

management reflects their operational reality if they opt in to expanded hours. The Board’s 

timeline for expanding operating hours is intended to provide institutions with time to evaluate 

and, if needed, adapt their organization to account for this and other considerations discussed in 

this notice. 35 

Some commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve impose regulatory or contractual 

requirements on Fedwire Funds Service participants to report, share, investigate, and mitigate 

fraud. Others asked about potential changes to Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement 

Service operational practices (for example, planned outages, cutoff times, or the closing time for 

the service’s business day). As noted in section IV, the Board is assessing public comments 

following publication of a separate Request for Information related to fraud considerations. In 

addition, the Reserve Banks will continue to collect input and consider enhancements to address 

the needs of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS participants through the Reserve Banks’ regular 

engagement with its participants. 

34 A few commenters also raised questions about the impact of expanded hours on rules applicable to futures and 
securities, including the Board’s Regulation T and the Security and Exchange Commission’s Rule 15c3-3. Changes 
to rules applicable to futures and securities are outside the scope of this Federal Register notice. Nevertheless, the 
Board has not identified a reason that expanding the hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS into the weekend 
would affect these rules. 
35 For example, institutions may need to factor expanded hours into their internal models for Regulation YY internal 
liquidity stress testing.

V. Competitive Impact Analysis 

Board policy requires that the Board conduct a competitive impact analysis when 

considering changes to a service. The policy requires the Board to first determine whether there 

will be a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete 

effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services and then, if such an adverse 

effect is identified, to determine if that effect is due to differing legal powers or the Federal 

Reserve’s dominant market position deriving from such legal differences. Next, if such legal 

differences exist, the proposed change would be further evaluated to assess its benefits and 

determine if the proposal could be modified. 36  

The Board continues to believe that an expansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

operating hours would not have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service 

providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve. In particular, the Federal Reserve 

provides the only large-value payment services in the United States that allow settlement in 

central bank money.  

36 See The Federal Reserve in the Payments System, supra note 1313. The policy states, “The Board will also 
conduct a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change, such as a change to a price 
or service, or a change to Regulation J, if that change would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability 
of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services due to 
differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the Federal Reserve deriving from such 
legal differences. All operational or legal changes having a substantial effect on payments-system participants will 
be subject to a competitive-impact analysis, even if competitive effects are not apparent on the face of the proposal. 
In conducting the competitive-impact analysis, the Board would first determine whether the proposal has a direct 
and material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve 
in providing similar services. Second, if such an adverse effect on the ability to compete is identified, the Board 
would then ascertain whether the adverse effect was due to legal differences or due to a dominant market position 
deriving from such legal differences. Third, if it is determined that legal differences or a dominant market position 
deriving from such legal differences exist, then the proposed change would be further evaluated to assess its 
benefits, such as contributing to payments-system efficiency or integrity or other Board objectives, and to determine 
whether the proposal’s objectives could be reasonably achieved with a lesser or no adverse competitive impact. 
Fourth, the Board would then either modify the proposal to lessen or eliminate the adverse impact on competitors’ 
ability to compete or determine that the payments-system objectives may not be reasonably achieved if the proposal 
were modified. If reasonable modifications would not mitigate the adverse effect, the Board would then determine 
whether the anticipated benefits were significant enough to proceed with the change even though it may adversely 
affect the ability of other service providers to compete with the Federal Reserve in that service.”

While some commenters questioned the need for expanding Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS operating hours given the availability of instant payment system (see section III.B), none of 

the commenters raised concerns about the effect expanding Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

operating hours would have on other service providers’ ability to compete effectively with the 

Federal Reserve. Where commenters raised competitive considerations, they were supportive of 

expanding the Fedwire Funds Service operating hours. The main private-sector provider of large-

value payment services and the large majority of commenters from large banks, financial market 

utilities, and fintech companies offered comments on the 2024 Notice explaining that they would 

benefit from an expansion of Fedwire Funds Service operating hours. In particular, these 

organizations indicated that an expansion of Fedwire Funds Service operating hours would 

improve efficiency and reduce risk in conducting U.S. dollar payments and settlements and 

would support private-sector payments efforts in the United States. For instance, expanding 

Fedwire Funds Service operating hours could improve liquidity risk management for payment 

systems that rely on the Fedwire Funds Service for prefunding (for example, a private-sector 

instant payment service, a large-value payment service, and a foreign exchange settlement 

system). Accordingly, an expansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours is not 

expected to adversely impact any other service provider that competes with Federal Reserve 

payment services and could instead support their efficiency and resilience. 

By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Deputy Secretary of the Board.

Board of Governors 

From:  

Staff 1 

Subject: 

Expansion of Fedwire® Funds Service and National Settlement Service (NSS) 
Operating Hours 

ACTION REQUESTED 

Staff requests approval to publish the attached Federal Register notice (FRN), in which 

the Board will announce that the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) will expand the 

operating hours of the Fedwire® Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 6 days per week, operating 

Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays (22x6), and will correspondingly expand the 

operating hours of NSS, with NSS closing 30 minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. In 

summary, the FRN expands operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS to include 

Sundays and weekday holidays. The FRN announces that the Reserve Banks are expected to 

implement this expansion in 2028 or 2029 to ensure technological, operational, and industry 

readiness. The FRN further states that (1) the expansion to 22x6 operating hours serves as an 

interim step and provides the necessary foundational capability for the Reserve Banks to expand 

operating hours up to 22x7x365 in the future; (2) the Board will monitor industry demand and 

will stand ready to offer an additional expansion up to 22x7x365 no sooner than two years after 

the Reserve Banks implement 22x6 operations; and (3) if the Board does propose to expand 

operating hours beyond 22x6, it will seek public comment in a separate proposal. The FRN states 

that participation in Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours will continue to be 

optional. Finally, the FRN announces that the Federal Reserve is exploring whether to expand 

discount window operating days in connection with the expansion of the Fedwire Funds Service, 

and that the Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional outreach to ensure it fully understands 

the considerations for institutions of various sizes related to expanded discount window

technical, non-substantive changes to the FRN prior to publication. 

BACKGROUND 

The Federal  Reserve Banks operate two large-value  payment services: the Fedwire 

Funds Service and NSS. The Fedwire Funds Service is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) 

service that allows participating financial institutions (participants) to send and receive 

individual electronic funds transfers up to one penny less than $10 billion in value that are 

immediate, final, and irrevocable. NSS is a multilateral settlement service that allows for 

immediate, final, and irrevocable settlement of obligations that arise from private-sector clearing 

arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector ACH network, and securities 

settlement systems.  

In May 2024, the Board published a request for comment on a proposal (the 2024 

Notice) to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service  and NSS  to 22 hours per 

day, 7 days per week, every day of the year (22x7x365). 2 Currently, the Fedwire Funds 

Service is open from 9:00 p.m. ET of the preceding calendar day to 7:00 p.m. ET, five days per 

week, Monday through Friday excluding holidays observed by the Reserve Banks, and NSS is 

open from 9:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET, five days per week, Monday through Friday excluding 

holidays observed by the Reserve Banks. 3 The 2024 Notice explained the potential benefits, 

costs, risks, and other considerations related to 22x7x365 operations, including how expanded 

hours might improve the safety and efficiency of both domestic and global large-value U.S. 

dollar payments, spur new or enhanced private-sector payment solutions, and increase the 

available time for settlement of large-value consumer and business payments in central bank 

money.  

The Board received 145 comment letters from a wide variety of stakeholders in the U.S. 

payment system in response to the 2024 Notice. Certain commenter segments expressed clear 

preferences on the proposal to expand operating hours to 22x7x365 based on their particular 

2 89 FR 39613 (May 9, 2024).  
3 The Federal Reserve has historically provided at least 30 minutes between the close of NSS and the close of the 
Fedwire Funds Service, recognizing that the Fedwire Funds Service is the primary alternative for orderly and 
efficient settlement of bilateral obligations in case a settlement arrangement is unable to complete its multilateral 
settlement through NSS.

needs and circumstances in the payment system. Most notably, a large majority of respondents 

from large banks, financial market utilities, service providers, fintech organizations, and related 

trade organizations supported the proposal. On the other hand, a large majority of small to 

midsize banks, related trade organizations, and individuals did not support the proposal, noting 

that in their view the costs and challenges related to staffing, operational changes, and 

competitive pressure from large banks, among other considerations, would outweigh the benefits 

from the proposal. In addition, many commenters expressed concern that expanding NSS hours 

could prompt private-sector ACH and check networks to expand processing days and settlement 

windows, potentially compelling their participants to operate on weekends. Further, a number of 

commenters from large banks, trade associations representing a range of bank sizes and capital 

markets participants, financial market utilities, and private-sector operators of payment systems, 

recommended that the Federal Reserve extend discount window operations to support liquidity 

needs during expanded hours. As discussed below and in greater detail in the FRN, staff’s 

recommendation on Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours is intended to address 

the range of feedback in the public comments.  

DISCUSSION 

1.  Recommended action  

Staff recommends that the Board approve the FRN’s announcement to  expand the 

operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service to 22x6 and to correspondingly expand the 

operating hours of NSS. The table below summarizes the recommended changes to operating 

hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, which would expand operating hours to include 

Sundays and weekday holidays.

9:00 p.m. ET – 6:30 p.m. ET, 
Sunday – Friday, including 
weekday holidays 

Staff recommends the Federal Reserve implement 22x6 operating hours in 2028 or 2029, with a 

specific time frame for launch to be determined based on participant readiness and outreach 

through established Reserve Bank communication channels. This time frame is consistent with 

requests from most commenters for a minimum two-year period to prepare for expanded hours 

following publication of this notice.  

The recommended action in the FRN includes additional announcements to explain the 

Board’s overall approach to expanding operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. 

Specifically, the FRN states that the expansion to 22x6 operating hours serves as an interim step, 

providing the operational capability for the Reserve Banks to expand operating hours up to 

22x7x365 no sooner than two years after the Reserve Banks implement 22x6 operations. The 

FRN further states that the Board will continue to monitor industry demand, and if the Board 

decides to propose an expansion of operating hours beyond 22x6, it will seek public comment in a 

separate proposal.  

2.  Rationale for recommendation 

The Federal Reserve has expanded operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and 

NSS over time in response to changing market conditions and industry demand. After considering 

public comments on the 2024 Notice, staff believes that an expansion of operating hours to 22x6 

would provide clear public benefits and advance the Federal Reserve’s objective to foster a safe 

4 The Fedwire Funds Service begins processing online payment orders beginning at 9:00 p.m. ET on the preceding 
calendar day (that is, following the expansion to 22x6 operations, on a weekly basis the Fedwire Funds Service will 
begin processing online payment orders at 9 p.m. ET on Saturdays, the opening time for Sunday operating hours). 
The Fedwire Funds Service begins processing online nonvalue messages at 8:35 p.m. ET on the preceding calendar 
day. The cutoff time for special account messages is 5:00 p.m. ET, the cutoff time for customer messages is 6:45 
p.m. ET, and the cutoff time for bank messages is 7:00 p.m. ET. The Fedwire Funds Service closes at 7:00 p.m. ET.  
5 The file processing window for NSS begins at 9:00 p.m. ET on the preceding calendar day and closes at 6:30 p.m. 
ET.

and efficient U.S. payment system. In particular, 22x6 operations will provide opportunities for 

more frequent settlement in central bank money that could enhance safety and efficiency in a 

range of payments, including cross-border U.S. dollar payments, large-value corporate payments, 

and funding payments for private-sector payment systems and market participants. Further, the 

potential safety and efficiency benefits of 22x6 operations could enable enhanced and innovative 

services in the private sector over time. For example, private-sector payment systems and 

participants may leverage an enhanced foundation for large-value settlement to support expanded 

trading days or enhanced payment services, providing additional benefits to the broader economy. 

Additionally, staff believes that expanding the hours of the Fedwire Funds Service would support 

the role of the U.S. dollar as the preferred currency for global settlement by expanding the 

foundational infrastructure on which global U.S. dollar settlement relies.  

Staff believes that expanding operating hours to include Sundays and weekday holidays 

will achieve a substantial amount of the benefits of 22x7x365 operating hours, while balancing 

the requests of many commenters for a phased expansion that maintains significant periods of 

downtime. Staff notes that initial demand for expanded operating hours for the Fedwire Funds 

Service, particularly with respect to cross-border payments, is most evident on Sundays and 

weekday holidays when international markets and other jurisdictions’ large-value RTGS systems 

are operating. In addition, staff believes that maintaining 26 hours of weekend downtime from the 

7:00 p.m. ET close of the Fedwire Funds Service on Friday to a  new opening time at 9:00 p.m. ET 

on Saturday would benefit institutions of various sizes that said weekend downtime facilitates 

regular system maintenance and testing, and will help institutions save costs on staffing relative to 

22x7x365 operations. Saturday downtime may also provide a helpful pause for financial market 

stakeholders during potential periods of market stress.  

Staff believes that correspondingly expanding hours for NSS will complement expanded 

hours for the Fedwire Funds Service, providing eligible institutions and private-sector payment, 

clearing, and settlement services with wider opportunities for real-time gross and multilateral net 

settlement of large-value payments in central bank money. 6 Further, the Board agrees with 

commenters that expanded hours for NSS would support resiliency in the payment system 

6 Expanding the operating hours of NSS is consistent with a goal of the Federal Reserve’s 2015 paper “Strategies for 
Improving the U.S. Payment System,” which noted that expanded hours for NSS could improve the settlement speed 
of and support innovation in private-sector arrangements.

because private-sector services are able to use NSS as a backup to the Fedwire Funds Service in 

contingency scenarios. 

Finally, staff’s analysis determined that the Reserve Banks would be able to achieve full 

recovery of costs over the long run associated with the proposed 22x6 expanded operating hours. 

Consistent with Board policy, staff believes that no other provider alone could be expected to 

provide this service with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. 

3.  Implementation details and considerations 

In addition to providing a general explanation of the Board’s decision and approach to 

implementing 22x6 operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, the attached FRN 

discusses other implementation considerations in relation to public comments, including 

considerations related to the opt-in model for these services; availability of the discount window; 

other potential enhancements to the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS; and the Fedwire Securities 

Service.  

Opt-in model. As explained in the FRN, participation in Fedwire Funds Service and NSS 

operating hours would continue to be optional. Opt-in availability allows institutions to participate 

in some, but not all, of the business day for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. During hours 

that the institution does not participate in the Fedwire Funds Service or NSS, the institution will 

not process transactions. Staff believes that maintaining the opt-in model for expanded hours will 

help participants avoid costs and challenges associated with operating during nights, weekends, 

and holidays.   

Staff acknowledges comments and concerns from a number of small institutions and 

related trade organizations that participation may not be optional in practice due to market factors, 

with the most notable reason being that private-sector ACH and check arrangements that use NSS 

could expand processing days and settlement windows to the weekend and require their 

participants to participate under the terms of those arrangements. To address this concern, the 

FRN clarifies that the Federal Reserve has no current plans to seek expanded processing hours for 

Federal Reserve ACH and check services. 7 Further, the FRN notes that the Board would likely 

need to seek public comment before committing to any additional same-day or weekend ACH 

7 In addition, the FRN notes that changes to ACH processing days would be subject to the Nacha rulemaking 
process. Nacha governs the automated clearinghouse network through its rules and standards. See About Us | Nacha 
- Administrator of the ACH Network, https://www.nacha.org/content/about-us.

processing windows, which would have a significant longer-run effect on the payment system. 8  

Availability of the discount window. The 2024 Notice sought comment on the need for 

discount window operations to support expanded hours for the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. 

Commenters recommended that the Federal Reserve extend discount window operations to 

include weekends and holidays, and several indicated that the discount window’s operating hours 

should be fully aligned with the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours to support liquidity 

management. Staff recognizes that, particularly given the large transaction-value limits on 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, it is important that adequate liquidity sources are available on 

days that the Fedwire Funds Service is operational. As a result, and recognizing the comments 

received on this topic, the FRN notes that the Federal Reserve is exploring expanding discount 

window operating days in connection with the expansion of the Fedwire Funds Service. As part of 

this exploration, the FRN explains that the Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional outreach 

to ensure it fully understands the considerations for institutions of various sizes related to 

expanded discount window operations.  

Other enhancements. In the 2024 Notice, the Board asked commenters whether other 

service enhancements would be beneficial in the context of expanded hours. The most requested 

enhancement was for a participant directory that would identify which Fedwire Funds Service 

participants are active during expanded hours. These commenters noted that such a directory 

could support more efficient payment flows and help prevent trapped liquidity in the network of 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS participants. In consideration of these comments, the FRN notes 

that the Federal Reserve intends to consider developing a participant directory, and the Reserve 

Banks will engage with participants to solicit feedback on whether and how to implement such a 

directory.  

Fedwire Securities Service. A small number of comments on the 2024 Notice asked for 

the operating hours of the Fedwire Securities Service to be extended alongside the hours of the 

Fedwire Funds Service and NSS, while other commenters agreed that the Board properly 

excluded the Fedwire Securities Service from its proposal. Staff recommends that the Board not

https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/board-staff-comment-letter-to-nacha-2024-12-13.pdf. (noting 
that the Board would likely need to seek public comment before adding more same-day ACH processing windows).

consider expanding operating hours for the Fedwire Securities Service at this time. 9 The FRN 

notes that the Board will continue to monitor potential demand and seek feedback from 

institutions to determine whether to pursue a future expansion of Fedwire Securities Service 

operating hours.  

RECOMMENDATION 

Based on the foregoing, staff recommends that the Board approve the attached FRN for 

publication in the Federal Register. Staff also recommends that the Board delegate to staff the 

authority to make technical, non-substantive changes to the attached materials to prepare them for 

publication in the Federal Register. 

Attachment 

9 Staff continues to believe that the expansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operating hours will not create 
significant changes in secured lending, derivatives markets, or other market activity that would necessitate expanded 
operating hours for the Fedwire Securities Service in the near term.
